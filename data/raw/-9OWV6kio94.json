    "transcript": "so today I'm going to show you a morning routine that you can do that's going to take 2 and 1 half minutes that I really want you to start incorporating every single day whether you're working out or you're not and it's the exact same thing that I do it's got three different parts that's going to really really help you I promise and it starts right here at the sink where I want you to just put a couple bottles of Po and spring water right next to your sink the night before cuz when you wake up the first thing I want you to do is drink them cuz what I know about myself and you likely is you're going to wake up dehydrated unless you're getting up in the middle of the night to drink water you're going to wake up dehydrated and you do not want to start your day that way even a 1% decline in hydration can lead to a 5% drop in mental and cognitive functioning which is not how you want to start your day the second thing by the way that scale down there I'm going to show you something you can do with that too but the second thing I want you to do is invest in a doorway pull-up bar and it's the perfect thing for you to set up is to put it somewhere in your bathroom in your closet whatever you have to do to make sure that you do this every single day CU if it's somewhere outside of your bathroom you're likely not going to do it and what I want you to is spend one minute just hanging from the bar like this and I want you to do it with two things happening number one your feet need to be in contact with the ground now I'm not waiting myself there but they're there to kind of help me to support my body cuz what the feeling you should have is a dropping of the pelvis as soon as I have my feet and I let go and I hang I should feel my pelvis separate from my spine to give me more spacing and decompression and that low back so anybody that has back pain is going to feel way better by doing this and even if you don't it's going to fortify yourself so that you don't have it in the future the second thing I want you to do from this position is try to just push your chest through the door other words lean myself forward through the door because what this does is it works on spine Health on the upper portion of your back that thoracic spine we spend most of the day in this position this Poe posture rounded out if I can get thoracic extension I can not only improve my posture but overall spine Health from top to bottom that's going to serve you well by maximizing that mobility of your back up all the way through the entire kinetic chain so I want to have this position here for one minute then when I'm done with that I shake my hands out take a brief little rest and I turn around and this time I'm going to allow my feet to come up and this position here is now obviously engaging the ABS so now I'm going to turn this into a core exercise it's also obviously a grip strength exercise and one of the things we know is that maintaining and maximizing grip strength as we get older is going to help us to maintain our health for longer right we decrease our risk of Falls and not only that but we just improve our overall function if we have a good strong grip so 1 minute of that and that's it however I did mention the scale before and it actually ties into the concept of grip and grip strength because instead of standing on this so you're welcome to do that what I want you to do is actually see if you can dig up one of these old versions of this type of scale not a digital scale but this type of scale and you extend your arms out in front of you and you squeeze as hard as you can you get a good measurement of how much force and grip strength you can exert onto the scale and what that does is it gives you a baseline to assess your neuromuscular recovery from your workouts because if you register let's say a baseline of whatever out there 100 if I drop by 10% on any given day on any given measurement it's a good indicator that you're not recovering from your training so if I were to drop down to 90 I might know that I need to sneak in an extra day of rest between workouts to make sure that I'm fully recovered before I start to do my workouts again that day it's just a good objective way to use yet another bathroom tool to give you more insight into what's going on in your body at this point guys when you've done this quick little routine you're ready for your day if you're looking for the workouts and the stretching and the meal plans of what's going to help you to feel your best and look your best you can find them over at aex.com if you found the video helpful share this routine with somebody else and I promise you it will help them as well click subscribe turn your notifications so you never miss a video when we put one out all right guys see you soon"
