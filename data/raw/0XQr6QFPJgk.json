    "description": "If you are doing “3 sets of 12” in your workouts to build muscle, then you must watch this before your next training session.",
    "transcript": "okay let's start this video off with a quiz \nyou're going to be put to the test here I want   you to watch Jesse perform a set of dumbbell \nincline bench press to 12 and I want to see   if you can spot what he's doing wrong all right \nso here he goes we can count along if you want   but pay close attention and see if you can spot \nthe mistake in this set you counting Jesse six okay do you see it yet we'll collect \nyour answer here at the end what number 11 good 12 cool all right so now what was the \nissue I don't know what was it so a lot of you   probably don't see the issue because you make the \nsame exact mistake but what I was doing was I was   actually secretly kind of counting here and I've \ngot a a stopwatch on my iPhone that says that he   performed this set in 27.3 seconds Speed Racer \nwhich is much too short and you're thinking why   what do you mean the length of the set when you \nperform your sets with the main focus being three   sets of 12 and you get attached to the numbers \nnow I made a video about this years ago and I   think it's incredibly important that you hear this \nconcept again and I'm actually going to expand   upon it when you get fixated on the numbers three \nsets of 12 you're already setting yourself up for   probably an imperfect set and one that's certainly \nnot going to deliver the growth that you're   capable of okay now the language that muscles \nspeak is tension we know that if you want your   muscles to grow if you want to stimulate muscle \nprotein synthesis you need to elicit tension in   those working muscles and we know there's a few \nways that you can do it we know that you can get   a lot of mechanical tension if you have a very \nheavy load in your hand so if Jesse was using   let's say a five rep max here he would have a lot \nmore tension being driven to the muscles he can   only get five repetitions if it was truly his Max \nand he went to failure but that amount of tension   is missing ing in a set to 12 let's say cuz it's \nnot that absolute amount of tension right the the   weights are less so what you'd have to do in that \ncase is you'd have to figure out a way to sort of   equalize that tension and one of the main ways \nthat we equalize the missing absolute mechanical   tension is to bring in some other drivers of \nhypertrophy namely Ecentric muscle tension   meaning the the lowering of the weights because \nwe know in and of itself that's a driver of more   growth well when we talk about 12 repetitions \nno one just picked that number at a thin air   they didn't say 12 why don't they say 11 why are \nnot all of your sets prescribed in your programs   to 11 repetitions instead 12 repetitions was the \none that sort of met the criteria of e of of of   eclipsing the 45 seconds of tension that seems \nto be significant for driving muscle gains when   you're using lighter weights and where that comes \nfrom is again the absolute amount of time it takes   you to perform one repetition realizing that the \nEcentric portion of that rep the lowering portion   would take more time on Jesse's repetitions there \nit really wasn't significant it was too quick what   you want to do is you want to be somewhere in the \nrange of around 2 to 3 seconds cuz what we know   is a half a second on the way down of a rep is a \nnon-controlled rep and that's not going to produce   much tension on the way down right a second would \nbe better but not as good as as where it could be   which would be more like 2 seconds or 3 seconds \nif you applied a 3 second Ecentric tension on the   way down and a 1 second concentric on the way up \nand we know that doing explosive repetitions is a   good thing you'd have 4 seconds per rep in a set \nof 12 you've gotten to a full 48 seconds for you   guys that do math out there 12 * 4 48 you've \ngotten into that range where we know we can   have enough of that accumulated time on renion \nto deliver the gains that we're looking for in   the absence of some of that really high weight \nthat we' be using now as a physical therapist   I would argue that controlled repetitions are a \nmust with what whatever rep range you're using   so the Ecentric portion of a lift even in those \nlower rep ranges is still incredibly important   if you want to have any longevity in the gym now \nthat's all good however a lot of things start to   go wrong when you fixate on this three set to 12 \nmentality because right off the bat Jesse take   these weights again yes sir if you find yourself \nperforming your sets and you're fixated on the rep   count go ahead and do a set to 12 to 12 now let's \nsay on the third repetition here it gets pretty   difficult let's just say like there's there's no \nway I'm getting to my 12 repetitions what would   you do I would start cutting my rep short like how \nrange of motion motion so go ahead so you start   pumping out a few half reps you're like okay well \nfour and five and six so you start to throw away   repetitions with the pursuit being I got to get \nto my 12 you're making a giant mistake there too   because this fixation on hitting a certain number \nand discrediting the value of the tension and the   intensity that's required on every set to drive \nnew muscle gains is a major mistake so if I go   and I perform my first few repetitions obviously \nthose are the easiest ones of a set they're not   going to be doing much of the the the actual work \nfor you if you then start cutting short the mid   reps because again you're afraid of not being \nable to reach the number 12 then you've kind of   thrown away the value of the middle reps as well \nand then when you get to the end and he starts to   say okay now I feel like if I resume my good full \nrange of repetitions I'll be able to get my 10 11   and 12 with good difficulty yeah but I would \nargue that it's a different impact in result   because the repetitions leading up to it to cause \nthe fatigue that that led into those final three   really productive repetitions isn't the same you \nlet go of all that when you kind of half ass to   repetitions in the middle of the set so that's a \nmistake take this concept and apply even further   to the sets portion of three sets of 12 why why \nis it that three seems to be the magical number   that we have to assign to Any Given exercise \nthat we're doing for a muscle group why can't   it be two why in some cases can't it just be one \nif you're so fixated on hitting your three sets   you can make a lot of other mistakes again join \nin and see if you've ever done any of these things   you do your first set and you say to yourself \nI'm never going to be able to get three sets of   this weight so instead of even completing your \nfirst set you bail on that weight you drop down   to something lighter that you know you'll be able \nto use for all three sets that's a mistake if you   could have gotten 12 repetitions it' be very very \nchallenging on that last rep you we're going to   failure then use that weight and simply drop the \nweight down when you got the sets two and three   yeah it's a better end goal again you're fixing \non being able to use 55 lbs for three sets of   12 don't get married to the numbers again the \nlanguage of muscles is tension not a number on   the side of the dumbbell if you make that mistake \nby fixating on the number of sets you would also   cost yourself an opportunity to maybe drive more \nof those available resources towards an additional   exercise that might just happen to hit the muscle \nfrom a different angle and therefore get a better   overall result for example if you're training your \nchest and you're fixated on doing your three sets   of flat bench right and by the third set because \nof what I just talked about here you didn't really   have much that you're getting from it anyway you \nkind of half ass your way through the first couple   sets but on the last set you're not even using \nthe appropriate weight to stimulate New Growth   from that set you would have been better off \nbailing at two and just putting the additional   set towards another exercise that hit the chest \nfrom a different angle in this case maybe a dip   right so you can hit some of the lower chest \nfibers rather than the upper chest and get a   more well-rounded impact on that muscle but \nwe fixate on these numbers and by doing so we   cost ourselves one other thing here that I want \nyou guys to understand don't fall in love with   12 you can build muscle from anywhere from five \nor six reps all the way up to 30 reps sometimes   even a little bit more as long as the effort is \nthere I will caution you though that as you start   to work into those higher rep ranges the tension \nthat you really need to find and and and sort of   you know dig down deep to find is a willingness to \ntrain through the burn because the stimulus that   becomes the driver of muscle growth there is the \nmetabolic stimulus the burn right even even the   pump itself will actually help you in this case \nbut you really want to be able to dig down into   that burn once it to burn is when the set starts \nand you want to be able to go and and and push   further again counting repetitions is not your \ngoal making all of your repetitions count is the   goal as far as the slow Ecentric because again \npeople get married to these Concepts all right   Jeff is saying go slow on the Ecentric not \nnecessarily in those really high repetition   sets 25 repetitions it's kind of nonsense because \nwhat kind of a Ecentric overload are you getting   with a weight that you could possibly lift for 25 \nrepetitions on rep two and three and four you're   going slow on the Ecentric it's like it's nothing \nyou're not getting any attention the focus there   shifts to your ability to withstand that burn \nbut not getting fixated on the numbers is the   best thing you can possibly do if you want to \nsee gains I'm not picking on three sets of 12   but cod damn it go look at any of your programs \nyou're doing right now I guarantee you there's   a lot of three sets of 12 prescriptions maybe \nthree sets of 10 the same thing applies there   too don't get married to those numbers instead \nunderstand that what you're trying to do is make   sure the effort is there to create muscle growth \nnot just the number being checked off and when   you do that guys I promise you you'll make the \nbest games you possibly can if you're looking   for complete programs guys where by the way we \nprogram in expanded set ranges do two to four   sets because I want you to have the flexibility to \nknow your body is unique to you and the stimulus   is what really matters the most not just checking \na box you can find them in our athx programs over   at aex.com I hope you found the video helpful \nguys if you haven't done so cck subscribe if   you haven't checked out the old video Jesse's \ngrown a bit since then you can watch that one   right over here as well in the meantime hope you \nguys subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video"
