    "description": "There are many different glute exercises but today, we are going to rank them so that you know which are worth your time and ...",
    "transcript": "And so even a high foot placement doesn't save \nthis exercise this placement at the bottom   of my list, the Leg Press has got to go. \n  What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com. \nWhat you see behind me is a bunch of different   leg exercises, specifically for the hamstrings \nand glutes. And they share a lot of functions   together, so we're going to group them together. \nBut not just that, I want to help you to find the   ones that are actually worth your time. Because \nwe're going to do what we always do here, we're   going to rank them from the best to the worst, \nleaving you only with the best exercises capable   of delivering the gains that you're after. \nSo, it's all these guys in our Exercises Rank   Series, we have to define the criteria for \nthe inclusion of these exercises in this list.   Number one, they have to be capable of being \nprogressively overloaded. Can you continue   to increase the resistance to keep those gains \ncoming? Number two, can you do these exercises and   create muscle growth and hypertrophy as the main \nfocus? Sure, there are strength exercises, but   for this list, they have to create muscle growth. \nAnd number three, guys, as a physical therapist,   as always, each of these exercises has to have \none thing in common. They all have to be \n  Don by me. \nOh, God. Where have you been? \n  I've been hanging in the \nback. Where have you been? \n  Why do you have to do the exercises? \nOh, I'm the one with the juicy booty,   remember? \nOh, I wish you'd stay away. Listen,   they all have to be safe and by being safe, \nwhat I'm talking about is they can't compromise   pain in order to deliver the gains that we're \nafter here, guys. So, each of these exercises   is going to fit that important criteria. \nAnd so, as always, we're going to start here   at the bottom of the list in the Worst Category \nand work our way up. And as I mentioned in the   open here, the hamstrings and glutes actually do \nshare some functions together. Both of them are   capable of extending the hip or bringing the legs \nstraight back behind the body. But the hamstrings   also have the capability of bending the knee. So, \none of the worst ways to do this, unfortunately,   is one of the most popular exercises and ways to \ndo it. It's the Prone Hamstring Curl. But before   you get too excited, trust me, there's going to \nbe better options ahead. The reason why I don't   like this particular version of the exercise is \nbecause of the position, being faced down. And as   you struggle to get that weight up and really \ntry to get your feet into that end position,   we oftentimes will drive our thighs down into \nthe pad. That engages the hip flexors, which,   as we know, attach to the lumbar vertebrae, \nwhich can start to pull on them and result in   low back pain or spasm. Not the way we want \nto really try to build our hamstrings.\n  As I mentioned, the exercise does fit the \ncriteria of hypertrophy and overload. But again,   knowing that there's better options ahead, I'm \nnot willing to take that trade off. So, for me,   it's going to start at the bottom \nof the barrel with a big red X. \n  Next up, we have a glute exercise and this one \nyou've probably seen before or done and it's just   a simple Heel Press. Now, this is a bodyweight \nexercise, easily done, no equipment limitations   here to get in the way. However, it still \ndoesn't make it very high on my list. Why? Well,   it's very much incapable of the overload that we \nseek in order to build muscle. You're doing mostly   a bodyweight movement here, and it's also very \nlimited in its range of motion. Even when it's   done correctly here, you're talking about a very \nlimited 10 to 15 degrees of motion for the entire   exercise. And even more than that, it's oftentimes \nmissed performed because this is one of those   exercises that easily leads itself to muscle \nsubstitution as we start to rotate the hips,   taking away some of the effort from the \nglute max. Guys, this is definitely one   that belongs here at the bottom and it's not going \nto deliver the gains that you're looking for.\n  So, between the last exercise and this one, I kind \nof feel like I'm pissing off a lot of people in   my audience and a lot of females. But it has to \nbe said, and I'm trying to deliver you the best   information and that exercise that has to go next \nis the Step Mill. And you guys have probably seen   this and maybe even seen the people who add that \nlittle flare of the hip extension at the end. It   still doesn't save the exercise. Why? Well, a lot \nof times these Step Mills are actually powered,   which means that as you step, the motor on the \nmachine brings your leg back down into extension,   not the muscles in your body. That's a problem. \nWhat makes this worse is the only muscles that   are working are your hip flexors once again, \njust to lift your foot up onto the next step,   only to take that ride back down. \nIt's not going to get you where you want to be,   and it could lead to some of that back pain we \ntalked about. Now, sometimes, if be lucky enough   to find a version of the machine that you actually \npower by driving your foot down into extension.   But at the end of the day, any exercise that can \nbe done for many, many, many minutes in a row   becomes less anaerobic and therefore less likely \nto deliver muscle gains and more aerobic. It   doesn't fit our categories or criteria here, and \ntherefore it also is going to get a big red X. \n  And so, if my ladies out there got maybe \na little bit mad at me, this time I'm   going to give everyone a chance to, because the \nnext exercise on this list is the Leg Press. Now,   look, I understand a lot of people have used \nthe leg press as an alternative to a squat,   especially if they have knee pains and problems \nand maybe even had seen some gains along the way.   My issue is, as a glute developer, it's a \nhorrible exercise, there's no way around it.   And I know people say, Well, Jeff, that's maybe \nbecause you're doing it incorrectly. You need to   put your feet high up on the platform in order \nto get more glutes and hamstrings. It doesn't   save the exercise, guys. And here's why. \nFirst of all, when we put our feet high up on   the plate, what we get is a lot of hip flexion, a \nlot of hip flexion, actually. You may not be able   to see it until I take the position at the bottom, \nand I simply turn it to a standing position, as   you would at the bottom of the squat. And there's \nno squat you've done that's ever looked like this   for good reason, because it's not a great way \nto do a squat. With this amount of hip flexion   what oftentimes happens is you get an extreme \namount of posterior tilt and lumbar reflection   that can compromise the stability of the low back \nand the SI joint. Two things we don't want to do,   but more than that, when we go back and we extend \nour legs, look at the excursion we go through,   what is the range of motion on the exercise? \nRemember, hip extension is what we're looking   for when we're trying to train the glutes. \nWe've gone through very little hip extension,   went from extremely flexed to moderately \nflexed, but still never even close to neutral,   let alone extended. The exercise does not do \na good job of targeting the glutes. Therefore,   it's going to stay here at the bottom of the \nlist with the big red X right through it. \n  And so, with that, now I get to break out my \nblue marker as we head up the charts here into   the Better Category. And for this, we need to go \nback and look at the same position we just talked   about with the Leg Press. It's the Dumbbell \nReverse Sprinter Lunge. And yes, you might notice   that same chest to thigh position, but there's \nsome very different things going on here.   Number one, with that one leg left behind us, \nwe're actually neutralizing the pelvis a little   bit and relieving some of that excessive posterior \ntilt, which makes this exercise a lot safer. But   more importantly, in terms of the effectiveness \nof it, we're overloading that hip extension.   We're getting not into that abbreviated range we \nsaw in the leg press, but we're able to overload   it through much more active hip extension. This \nis one of my favorite ways to do the movement.   And for those of you who I mentioned that had knee \npain on squats, this is going to give you a chance   to relieve yourself of a lot of that pain and \nstill get the gains that you were looking for   in the first place. So, for me, it gets the \nfirst blue circle in the Better Category.\n  Next up in the Better Category is one of those \nstep ups from the exercise that we're in the Worst   Category. And if you're going to do those Heel \nPresses, you might as well do instead a Standing   Cuff Kickback. And this is where you take one \nof those cuffs and put it around your ankle and   just kick back against resistance. And that's the \nkey against resistance, because what was lacking   in that first exercise, as you remember, was the \noverload and resistance capable of creating any   type of muscle growth. Well, here we can get \nthat. And more importantly, while it may still   encourage some of those muscle substitutions that \nwe talked about with the Heel Press before being   on your feet proprioceptively allows you to move \nyour leg back easier in a straighter line. So,   while it's still a small range of motion, it's one \nthat you can perform more effectively and easily.   And as I said, overload it. It gets the next up \nin the Better Category with the blue circle. \n  And so when it comes to exercises that hit \nthat posterior chain, both the hamstrings   and the glutes, the RDL and its many variations \nare always going to find their way on that list.   However, when we're looking for esthetics or \nathletics and we want to get the balance that   we might lack right now, splitting up the legs \none at a time is where we're going to turn to the   Dumbbell Single Leg RDL to accomplish that. And \nwhat I like about this exercise is it does give me   a chance to either focus a little bit more on the \nhamstrings by keeping the leg a little straighter   or a little bit more on the glutes by allowing \nthe knee to bend more as I lean forward. So, if   your main pursuit was to grow bigger hamstrings, \nthe overloaded aspect of this with the dumbbells   will give you that leg up. However, because \nthe balance might become your limiting factor,   it's not the best option for you. So, it's \ngoing to get a ranking of Better, but just   not Best yet. We have better options coming. \nAnd so, with that, I now get to break out my   yellow marker as we continue to work our way \nup the charts, this time to the Better Still   Category. And what I like to do here is give \nyou that next best option that I just mentioned.   And we're talking about the Single Leg RDL, well, \nlet's start doing it with a cable rather than a   dumbbell. Because what this does is it gives us \nall the same benefits, we just talked about with   more stability. Why? Because the cable actually \ngives us more control in the frontal plane.\n  What I mean is if you held that dumbbell in \nyour hand, it can kind of float in all three   directions. But with the cable, you're actually \ncontrolling that side-to-side frontal plane motion   a little bit. Which actually lends additional \nbalance to you, which takes that exercise   that was supposed to be driving those glute and \nhamstring gains and actually allows it to do so   without having your balance undercut you. So, it \ngets the first in the Better Still Category. \n  And so, I promised you I wouldn't bury the \nHamstring Curl all together, that I give   you a better option. Well, all you have to do is \nchange the way you perform the exercise. And this   is sitting on your butt. That's right. A Seated \nHamstring Curl is a much better option. Why?   Because we're fixing all the things we saw \nwrong with the earlier versions. And you   can see that when you perform the exercise from \nthis position, your knees and thighs actually go   down towards hip extension rather than into \nhip flexion as you bring your knees back.   And what's good about this is you still get \nthe ability to grow those hamstrings through   isolated knee flexion and overload. But we don't \nhave to have that negative side effect that came   by just being in the opposite prone position \nwhere their knees driving into hip flexion,   all those low back pains go away, \nbut the gains are actually here. So,   the Seated Hamstring Curl is a much better \nalternative for those looking to use a machine.\n  And speaking of improvements, let's keep them \ncoming. Instead of doing those Heel Presses   or even the Standing Cuff Kickbacks, we have \nanother option here it's the Banded Step Through.   And what you'll notice about this exercise is that \nit gives you more range of motion, so therefore   more resistance through hip extension, making \nit a better exercise. And once again, the bands   will give you the opportunity to progressively \noverload to a higher resistance band, which will   continue to allow you to progress the exercise as \nneeded. Now, this is one that I like to use with   my athletes. Not just because of what I just spoke \nabout, but also because it tends to help you as a   mobility drill to get into deeper and deeper hip \nflexion. There's a lot of good to say about this,   and it's certainly the best variation we've talked \nabout so far to accomplish the same thing. So, the   Banded Step Through gets the yellow circle. \nNow the criteria for this list was to choose   exercises that were capable of driving high \nlevels of conditioning and power. Then this   next one would be way at the top of the list, but \nit's not, so, it falls here. We're talking about   the Kettlebell Swing. Now, this exercise is one \nof the best ways to train the glutes and to do   so explosively. But it also almost automatically \nguarantees that you learn to hinge properly. And   the hinge is the foundation of glute activation. \nIf we can learn to hinge properly at the hips,   then we can engage the glutes at the right time \nand learn to ultimately recruit them and grow   them better. Now, the limitations oftentimes \nis the load that we use here, unless you have   access to a very heavy kettlebell or one that's \nchallenging for you, you're not going to find   the ability to overload this enough to keep the \ngains coming once you've reached a certain point.   But it certainly is an amazing exercise and one \nthat deserves a spot here up high on the list and   the last one in the Better Still Category. \nAnd so now I get to break out my green marker   as we continue to work our way, all the way up \nto the top. But we're stopping just short here   in the Almost Best Category in the place we're \ngoing to start is with an improvement on those   Kettlebell Swings. We're talking about the Pull \nThrough. Now, once again, we have a ground-based   exercise like the Kettlebell Swing, which I like. \nBut we also get a chance to load this a little bit   more heavily because we have the option to just \nmove that pin up the weight stack more and more   to accommodate our increasing strength \ngains and ultimately size gains. Now,   I also like the fact that this is once again \nreinforcing all the good things about the swing   through that hip hinge overload. And what's nice \nabout this exercise is oftentimes for people, when   you remove the speed component of the Kettlebell \nSwing, they have a much easier time getting to   a good glute contraction, which ultimately is \ngoing to drive the hypertrophy you're looking   for. So for me, the Pull Through gets the first \ngreen circle in the Almost Best Category. \n  To me, this next exercise is one that's way too \noften underutilized, but one that we use often   with our athletes and it's the Dumbbell Leaning \nForward Step Up. And what's great about this   movement is you can easily load it depending upon \nthe weight of the dumbbells that you grab. But   what's nice is just by changing the orientation \nof your body prior to starting the exercise,   you can shift the load more from the quads to \nthe glutes and hamstrings. So, we just assume   this forward tilt of our torso before we start \nthe ascent on every rep. So, what this does is   it just preloads the glutes. So now as I press \ndown through my foot and drive myself up and   get as close as I can to full hip extension, \nand I even have that good eccentric loading on   the way back down again. I can train one leg at \na time to overcome those muscle imbalances and   weaknesses. It's going to get another green \ncircle here in the Almost Best Category. \n  And so, I mentioned before that the glutes \nand hamstrings prefer to work together.   If we had an exercise that allowed us to overload \nand resist knee flexion and also hip extension,   then we would have a great exercise. Well, this \npair of exercises actually allows you to do just   that. And regardless of whether you have access to \nthe equipment, you're going to have an option to   do it. And we're talking about either the Glute \nHam Raise or The Slick Floor Bridge Curl. And   what you can see here is, again, that coordinated \neffort between the glutes and hamstrings. On the   Glute Ham Raise you get that initial contraction \nfrom the glutes to stabilize the pelvis and assist   in the driving of the whole body up into this \nknee flex position. And of course, this is a   tremendous overload on the hamstrings. And we can \nactually increase the load here as we want to by   simply adding additional plate if needed. \nBut let's say you didn't have access to this   machinery. Well, you can do what I always \nshow here is a The Slick Floor Bridge Curl,   and this is a body weight variation and it's a \nlot harder than it looks. You're basically doing   the same thing here, you're starting with a glute \nbridge through good hip extension, maintain that   throughout and then actively and dynamically using \nyour hamstrings to curl your legs in and back out.   A good eccentric overload here, too. The key, \nas always, is to keep your glutes really, really   high while you're moving your feet back and forth. \nAnd even here, if you want an additional overload,   try to do this one leg at a time. It is not easy. \nEither way, you're getting that holy grail, that   good combination of the activation of both those \nmuscle groups together, and therefore it gets that   big green circle in our Almost Best Category. \nAnd so, as we've done here a few times on this   list already, we've made the improvements and now \nwe're going to make that ultimate improvement when   it comes to the RDL. So instead of the single leg \nvariations, we can now move towards the classic   Barbell RDLs and with good reason. Because if \nyou're pretty confident that you don't have any   of those underlying left or right imbalances, \nthen this is going to give you the best chance   to overload the exercise and create the most \ngrowth in both the hamstrings and the glutes. \n  And again, with a lot more stability since \nyou're not in any single late balance situation.   An additional plus for the exercise is \nit's a good accessory movement to help you   if you struggle at all with that and range of a \ndeadlift. It just has a lot of utility here and   it's one of the best exercises you can do for \nthe posterior chain. It has to be on this list,   and it has to be somewhere at the very top, \nit belongs to the Almost Best Category. \n  And so, any good list of leg exercises wouldn't \nbe good if it didn't have some variation   of a squat on it. For us, it's going to be the \nlow bar variation. And there's a reason for   this because it sets your body up to recruit \nthe posterior chain muscles more effectively.   By simply carrying the bar lower on those \nlower rear delts, you're going to have   to pitch your torso forward at a bit of an \nangle. What this does, as I mentioned before,   is it recruits those posterior chain muscles more \neffectively, and it carries through as you go down   into the bottom portion of the squat. Allowing \nyou to more effectively drive out of the squat   and also handle heavier loads. The progressive \noverload was never in doubt here, nor was its   placement at some point on this list. Ultimately \nhere, way up high, the Low Bar Squat is going to   be the last and the Almost Best Category. \nAnd so, some of you might be thinking, but   what about some of the other exercises that Jeff \nhas shown in the past that have been very, very   helpful? Well, I would consider those corrective \nexercises either done for neuromuscular activation   or to overcome a glute medius weakness or \nsome sort of hip imbalance. They wouldn't   necessarily find a home on this list when we're \ntalking about hypertrophy and growth. However,   stay tuned, that one's coming. \nAnd so that leaves us with only   one. And of course, there can only be one \nwhen it comes to the best of the best. You   weren t looking over my shoulder the whole time, \nwere you? Well, whether it's a surprise or not,   we're talking about the Barbell Hip Thrust. And \nthis exercise simply checks all the boxes when   it comes to glute development. Yes, you can \nprogressively overload it very easily. Yes,   you can perform it safely. And yes, it's \ngoing to provide the muscle hypertrophy   that you're looking for. Or as Jesse said, \nIt's going to help you grow that juicy booty.   The reason why this exercise sits way up here at \nthe top, even above our beloved squat, is because   muscle activation studies will prove how much more \nsuperior this is when it comes to recruiting the   glutes on any exercise. Throw in the fact that \nthe resistance curve here is superior as well,   ensuring that we have a heavy load placed on those \nglutes in peak contraction. Guys, this is just   the best exercise when it comes to delivering the \ngains that you really want. And it also has those   hamstring isometric benefits built in as well. \nThis is going to get that Green Star as the best   of the best in our glute exercise rankings. \nSo, if you're looking for quads, that's coming   soon.
