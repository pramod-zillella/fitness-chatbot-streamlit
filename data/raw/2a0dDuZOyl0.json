    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM. It's one of those late night choices again. Do I skip my workout and figure out any excuse\nto not do it? Or, do I take you guys along for the ride\nwith me and get started and get to work? Guys, you know it wouldn't be a very interesting\nvideo if I chose the first option. So, it's time for me to get my ass going. So there you have it guys, 27 minutes later,\nmy work is done for the night. Now I can relax. Guys, if you've been following me on Team\nATHLEAN for any length of time, you recognize your exercises, you recognize your workout. There are elements of ATHLEAN XERO, AX1, AX2,\nNXT, everything is combined into this workout. We did it in 27 minutes. I kicked my ass, and now it's time to get\nout of the gym and recover and grow. If you haven't already, guys, and you want\nto come on Team ATHLEAN, pick your starting spot. If you're just starting out, AX1 is the place\nfor you. If you're looking for an all bodyweight, completely\nno equipment option, ATHLEAN XERO is for you. You work your way up through the progression:\nAX!, AX2, and then up to that next level, NXT. In the meantime, guys, hopefully this video,\nthis exact workout, was helpful for you. And if it was, leave your comments and a thumb's\nup below, and I'll keep making the videos. Alright guys, we'll be back here again soon. Goodnight, literally."
