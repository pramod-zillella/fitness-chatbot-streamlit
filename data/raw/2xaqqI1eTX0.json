    "transcript": "Jessie what are you doing Oh your wrist what bicep push-ups where you some bicep push-ups you know biceps just like they work your triceps no man there's biceps its bicep pushup do you remember you two chest exercises yes you remember the kettlebell clean yes have you decided to stop making up exercises apparently not I can't take you what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com so if you want to build big biceps you want to do it at home the one thing you don't do is a bicep pushup look I actually didn't know this existed until Jesse showed it to me if I had to pick an exercise to help me to build big biceps at home it would fall all the way down here on that list for what you'd actually use because it doesn't work and instead of just kind of bash on it here I want you guys to understand why it doesn't work because that opens up the whole bunch of possibilities about the things that do work and I'm not gonna leave you hanging I'm gonna show you the things that work and also show you a couple of things I think that fit all the way up here on the top of the list alright so let's talk about the bicep push-up again this is what it looks like Jesse was actually doing it right it just is not good why because guys we will talk about the biceps there's a few things that it does right we know that it flexes the elbow we know that it can supinate the forearm we can see it work even just by doing that and then we know that the last thing in order of its preference is to actually help to assist in shoulder flexion to bring the arm up when we look at that exercise we see the first thing that it does is it's actually extending the elbow it literally is working under load to extend the elbow the exact opposite function of the bicep meaning the tricep is what's working to bring you from this position to this position beyond that we have this other component of supination and because we get into this position some will argue that that is actually supinated so therefore you have tension on the biceps which you don't because two things are happening number one when you get your hands back into this position you're locking them in place so you're not supinating under load you're getting into a supinated position and then locking them in place the third thing is that shoulder flexion and if there's anything going on here you're getting some flexion but you're going from a very extended position to a less extended position but I'm still not in shoulder flexion so that's not even viable so the last thing we're talking about here is you really have maybe a stability contribution from the biceps and this is why that happens because you take your hands you put them back here and then you have your hands down closer to your waist so when you're out in front here I want to fall in that position here I want to fall in that position here I want to fall in that direction the only thing that's gonna prevent me from falling this way because my hands are back so far is to exert a force into the ground that basically does this to slide me back and to keep me more in this position but since the hands aren't actually sliding and there's no resistive flexing here at the elbow then we're not getting that so all we're getting is this isometric tension on the biceps in this position out of the least-significant position of the biceps function meaning almost at full extension you're getting that type of isometric force at almost full extension if you're gonna get isometric force on anything do it from here from a flexed position to get at least something out of it so all in all guys that exercise fails in so many levels and one last thing as a physical therapist that I see from this that's horrible is what it does to your wrist you see right here there's an area of cartilage that's very susceptible to having forced place through the wrist from a very hyper extended position and when you flip your hands around like that and then bear all that weight down there towards the ulnar side of your wrist here that causes something called tfcc injury which is definitely very common especially for people that aren't prepared for those types of forces so all in all not a good choice so what would you do well if you want to move just a little bit up that continuum what you do is you can use your own body as a form of resistance but understand that that resistance has to be into flexion of the elbow not extension of the elbow like we talked about so I've covered a few things before in the past you can land on your side you grab your leg here it's called a sideline bicep curl and you pull yourself up you is this great no it's not great but you're getting at least resisted flexion I'm actually working the biceps by trying to pull my weight up minimize the contribution of the ABS you can make it a little bit more difficult by laying on your back and put your hand on your under your lower leg like this and then you lift yourself up that way the difference being that once your shoulders leave the mat here you have more weight that you have to pull up whereas on the sidelines you're getting a little bit of assistance from your arm into the ground but again sort of a step up but not great I've also shown you how you can use your own leg and no not the weight of your damn leg that's not what's providing the resistance there it's the fact that you can push with your leg to create accommodating resistance in other words I could take my leg here and push it out in this direction and create an eccentric overload on the biceps or I can just simply push in that direction to make the concentric portion having to pull this up if this is pushing back it makes it more difficult for the bicep to do the work but all those guys fall into sort of that middle-of-the-road category but if you don't have any options you don't have any equipment then that's what you would do but here's my suggestion get a damn pull-up bar because when you do that for a very inexpensive outlay of money here you open up the possibility to actually get some really good bicep exercises you have the option to do chin-ups you have the option to do bicep chin curls like we showed before you have the option to do something like even a negative eccentric hang where you just simply try to hold on as long as you can and aseptically load and overload the biceps you can go even more difficult and either throw a little bit of weight around your waist if you have the option to do weighted Chin's or you simply try to do a one-armed chin up with assistance from the other hand it just opens up so many better possibilities but understand this they're all resisting the flexion part putting the load on the bicep on the elbow closing down and creating flexion not while I'm extending it and remember when we're falling down the bicep push up towards the ground yes you are bending your elbow here but it's happening because gravity's doing the work for you whether or not I tried to lower myself down in order to control or I just let myself drop I'm gonna flex the elbow because gravity is doing all that work for me just because you go into that range doesn't mean that that's being resisted you have to focus on what is being resisted to finally benefit for you and the exercise you're doing so hopefully I didn't bash then that went too bad jesse was wrong again it's okay he does that from time to time and many times you're looking for a program that does get it right or athlean xero program is a bodyweight only program that requires no equipment whatsoever you can find that over at athleanx.com and found the video helpful leave your comments thumbs up below for finding these breakdowns these exercises helpful I hope it clarifies maybe even sells a few arguments for you people were asking me to do this in an Instagram live a few days ago and I was like why it doesn't work the biceps but now maybe this clarifies it and if you have already done so guys make sure you click Subscribe a turn notification so you never miss a new video when we put one out our guys see you soon [Music] you"
