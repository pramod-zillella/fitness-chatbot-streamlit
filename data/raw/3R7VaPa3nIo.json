    "transcript": "[Music] what's up guys Cavalier aex.com today we're going to talk about a topic that is definitely a buzz right now in the fitness industry and that is restrictive blood flow training or occlusion training and whether or not it's something that you can safely do should be doing it all or whether it even works in terms of what it's claiming to do is to help you to build bigger muscles now first of all I think that there is a place for occlusion training um obviously you should get screened by your physician because this is a restrictive blood flow procedure we're basically restricting the return the Venus return of blood from a working muscle if you have any type of blood pressure issues you should certainly get cleared and ask your doctor if he thinks it's a good idea because here's the main point this is just an intensity technique it's no different than other intensity techniques that provide us with the opportunity to push ourselves a little bit further now there are some things that that qualify this as uniquely different and I'll explain that in just one second but it's no different than doing Drop sets than doing uh extended sets pyramid sets things to negative only sets things to sort of again increase the intensity of your workout now that being said what people claim with occlusion training is that you're basically going to put a tourniquet I'm going to show you how to do it here with a band so you don't NE necessarily even have to go out and get uh wraps or separate wraps if you're already own one of the athex Bands here you're restrict ing the flow of blood out of the working muscle through the veins back towards the heart you're not putting a tourniquet on so much so that you're restricting blood flow to the muscle people will theorize that with this uded Blood the fact that you can't actually get all this return you're getting a pooling of the blood that you're you're creating a hypoxic condition or you're lacking oxygen which automatically starts to fatigue the oxygen dependent type one muscle fibers so you're sort of immediately jumping into the type two fibers that's a pretty cool thought it's a good idea and practice again it's very much being researched right now but some of the early research is showing that that's true so we're getting a jump or faster progression here to type two fibers secondly what we're doing is creating a an accumulation of the metabolites of muscle tissue normal metabolic stress on a muscle and metabolic stress has been shown to create a signal for hypertrophy in a muscle so again another cool thing and certainly number three we're going to get a pump here no doubt I'm going to demonstrate it here for you one arm I'm not going to include the other one I'm going to include just so you can see the difference we're going to do the same protocol though which is a band now here's what you do you take your band here and you wrap it you twist it once upon itself so I twist it here and then now I have a loop I'm going to put that around my arm up top right up above my bicep now I'm going to twist once and wrap through again I'm going to grab two of them like this twist again this way and then come through all the way now for me those three turns that's enough cuz what you're looking for here is not so tight that you restrict again arterial blood flow then you're going to have some problems we want our blood to be able to flow into this muscle we don't want it to be able to return so we have the occlusion right up above the bicep you can see all all of a sudden I'm a pretty vinous guy I can get some veins filling up with blood now the protocol is you usually want to do something that allows you to train fairly light so people often do this on cable machines I'm going to do it with resistance bands I'm going to take my my tubing I'm going to have it to the resistance that I know this is a pretty thick band would allow me to do 30 reps the first set you do 30 reps of then you take a 30 second rest then you go 15 reps 30 second rest 15 reps 30 second rest 15 reps 30 second rest four sets the whole thing should take you a very short period of time no more than 10 minutes you don't want to stay occluded for very long okay so we're going to go 30 reps five8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 278 30 okay do not take take them off keep it on it's going to hurt right we have a deoxygenated condition here in this arm this one was de oxygen while we were working out right that's what happens that's why they feel that lactic acid burn however I'm able to shakee this one out and let it go this one's not as uh fortunate so we're resting 30 seconds we're going to come back here and do the next set and we're going 30 reps you'll see a difference in color probably this one going to turn a little bit more purple if it starts to turn purple and blue and you know you might want to bail on this intensity technique okay but again right now it's working perfectly fine for me now 15 reps three four five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 again I'd like to take this off but I can't at the moment one advantage this has is again if you're medically cleared you have no issues with blood pressure this is actually a good thing for uh guys who are a little bit older who have joint problems because you don't have to train as heavy to still get their hypertrophy response so it's actually becoming fairly popular with guys that are a little bit older or already dealing with uh joint issues but again it's a technique guys it's not something you're going to start going and doing every single time you train just as you wouldn't do uh a drop set every single time that you train here we go for set number three and again look at the differences and color between the muscles now it's killing again you can probably see the difference here between the two so I got one more set and then we'll be able to let the tourni kit off rest in 30 seconds or so I'm going to go out wide make it tough one 2 3 four 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 and definitely a lot more stress on this arm here just feels a lot more fatigued a lot harder than it was here on this side but you can see the difference here in the occluded muscle even look the veins in the forarm obviously restricting the blood flow the venous return back and here not as much okay so now I get to take this damn thing off okay and there you have it so guys again recapping the protocol 30 15 15 15 use generally something that allows you to be a little bit lighter in weight U machine very controlled you should be focusing on the movement not cheating your way through the Reps tubing is another great example and a great way to do this if you're training at home uh good for people to get a little bit of a lighter like offset some of your heavier lifting but you don't want to replace your heavier lifting your heavier lifting is always going to be important when it comes to building bigger muscles but if you use this as a technique you can certainly do that guys if you're looking to build bigger arms I think we've got the market corner there our ultimate arm program
