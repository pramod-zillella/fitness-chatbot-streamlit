    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we're talking all about the push-up you know that basic body weight exercise that works your chest your shoulders and your triceps if you're doing it right and we've covered that before well guess what it actually does a lot more than that you see it does build those three muscle groups but there's variations if you're willing to explore them that are going to work the whole rest of your body and I promise you by the end of this video you're gonna pick up at least two or three different variations you never thought of before that you're going to want to start doing so with that being said guys let's see how we can expand that muscle repertoire from just those classic three two a hell of a lot more so now I talked about all the different areas are going to be able to hit with the push-up but let's start with the obvious here the chest and there's actually a couple of things you can do that I've covered here before that are going to allow you to have a greater influence on the chest because you can include a component of adduction into your push-up and I know you're probably thinking how do we add duct our arms together if they're fixed together on the ground well we have two different ways we can do it the first is with an isometric variation and this is called a squeeze up you see I don't want you to think about pushing your body off the ground as much as I want you to think about squeezing your body off the ground though the hands won't move any closer to each other if you apply that inward force on the ground towards each other you'll get that isometric contraction of the chest that's going to allow you to feel it take over and be the main driver of the push off the ground as opposed to necessarily the shoulders or the triceps and we can take it a little step further and get some adduction with a move like this and it's the rotating push-up and this here gives us something called relative adduction in other words I'm not actually taking my arm across my body but I know that I can actually turn my body in space to create that adduction so if my hands are fixed here on the ground and as I push up I rotate that way you can see if I turn back to Center that I've actually created adduction at the shoulder joint meaning I got a better contraction in my chest so both of these variations are gonna be powerful when it comes to influencing a little bit more chest activation out of this classic exercise the second of the most obvious muscle groups hit by a push-up is the triceps but here again we do have some options to sort of increase the activation by just changing how we do the exercise and the first one here is called the pancake pushup and it's essentially what you're trying to do is to do a tricep pushdown with a straight bar except you don't have a tricep pushdown machine and you'll have a straight bar all you have is your body in the floor and you can see the position of the forearms gives me that same relative position that I'd have and a tricep pushdown and all I'm trying to do is extend through the elbows and as I come up here you can see that there's a tremendous amount of load that's applied to the triceps in this position a lot of us will find that we probably have to drop down to our knees even at the more advanced level just to be able to handle the amount of weight that you're lifting here and we can go a little bit further I talk all the time about the value of trying to train the tricep longhead because we know it makes up a large portion of the mass of the triceps and to do that and to get a complete contraction you need to have your arms sort of at the level of your body or behind with the elbow fully extended and that's where the Cobra push-up proves to be very valuable the setup of the exercise has a start with our elbows tight to the side and as we come up and shift our chest forward we get that positioning of the arms back behind our body into extension with that straightened out arm and you can see the long head get into a complete contraction here there's no other variation of the push up that is going to engage the triceps into this type of contraction as long as the arms are out in front of your body you got to get them tight or behind in order to experience something this strong so when it comes to the shoulders again we know that the regular push-up does a good job of hitting the shoulders but a lot of times we don't necessarily want them to do the work right we talked about with the chest how you want to get that chest out in front so it takes on the lion's share of the lobe but if we wanted to develop our shoulders more so with the push-up how can we do that just make a few of these variations and the first one you see here is just a modified planche version of the pushup meaning we're getting our arms in our hand position way back as far back as we can without tilting forward and what that does is it shifts the load away from the chest more to that front delt and you can see it doing the workload here as I push up in every rep the other thing we can do here is this push away press and this now obviously forces our body to change the direction that we're pushing so instead of pushing straight up and down with our chest doing most of the work we can actually make our shoulders do more than work by pushing away and again we could take this even a step further and turn it into a pike variation and with the pike you're just getting that vertical position or more of a vertical position but again we could take this even one step further and actually go completely vertical against the force of gravity now this would be like doing a standard overhead press at the barbell and then finally we can shift the focus on a push-up more to the middle delt I'm glad you asked Jessie we can actually do it here with this bodyweight side lateral raise and I showed you again this is the concept of that relative movement and this is relative abduction at the shoulder we know that if we can get the arm in this position here this would be abduction with a side dumbbell lateral raise that would work the shoulder well why can't we keep that arm fixed and then rotate the body and create that same relative positioning into abduction well we can as you just saw we get in this position here and we drop down to the ground so that when we come out of it we're still pushing up the upper portion of our bodyweight as we get up we're rotating up towards the sky to get that fully abductors shoulder and you can see the middle delt here is lit up the fact is this is a great way to hit that middle delt with just a slight variation on this popular exercise all right so now that concludes the more obvious push up variation portion of this video like maybe you even tried a bunch of those before but this is where it gets interesting you see because this is where we've seen how we can train a hell of a lot more than just our pushing muscles when we do these exercise variations I'm going to show you and we start here with the back we know that the back is one of those muscle groups that tends to get a little bit underserved in the whole training environment but now you got some more options this is probably my favorite this is the sliding pulldown pushup I know it sounds a little bit weird but this is what it does we know that there's an exercise called the straight arm push down and what that does is it works your lats it takes them full of fully stretched position down here close to your side's abducted squeezed and you feel your lats working well we can do the same thing here with just your floor but what we're trying to do is it pull ourselves back to that push-up position by using our lats and getting our lats and elbows driven back down into our sides the next exercise we have here is the thumbs up push-up and this one's a little bit tricky what you're doing here is you're trying to drive your fists with your thumbs up down into the ground in your forearms down to the ground they're in this w position to try to get into a more of an externally rotated position to protect your shoulders but really what we're doing is we're driving through protraction of the shoulder blades you're gonna feel the muscles deep under the shoulder blades doing the work here a lot of people say they feel it through the back itself as you're getting some protraction of the shoulder blades but the key here is that you're driving through a different set of muscles and you're gonna feel it work in a different way and then finally we have our back Widow exercise and this is where we take the push up when we literally flip it upside down and remember the true definition of a push-up is just pushing your body off of the floor well that's what we're doing here it's a bodyweight exercise where we're pushing our body off the floor except this time we're faced up instead of face down you can see that we've now just completely directed all the focus away from the front side to the back side and all of the muscles here on the back side the rear delts the rhomboids the lower traps the upper traps they're all doing a hell of a lot of work here just to get into this position and now we move on to the legs that's right the legs for a push-up you see there's actually some amazing ways to incorporate your legs into a push-up and my first place I want to start right here is with the area that tends to get underserved anyway and that's the glutes and hamstrings the posterior chain muscles and one of the best ways you can do this is with this glute ham raise push up the glute ham raise itself or the Nordic raise is one of the best exercises you can do to incorporate glute and hamstring activation together most of the time we tend to let the hamstrings dominate and not let the glutes work in concert well here we get this eccentric loading of those two muscle groups as we lower down to the ground and we utilize the push up to help to get us back up to the position where we can get engagement of those muscles to then pull the rest of the way so we get a concentric activation of the hamstrings and glutes on the way up from probably the mid way up to the top and then of course eccentric way all the way down to the point where we catch ourselves in the push-up we can move on from here and do this exercise variation also and this is called the ham curl pushup what you do is you anchor your feet on the other side of something that's not going to move and as we use our hands to push up off the ground again we're focusing on allowing the hamstrings to help to dig backwards into the ground to assist us in getting our body up but it's not just hitting the hamstrings as I get up to the top here you can see all the posterior chain muscles of my back once again are working and again even the triceps are working as I extend through the elbows so now we can't hit the and hamstrings without turning our focus around to the front and getting the quads involved here too now look we're not talking about max squats here to build massive thighs but what we are talking about is an option to get the legs at least involved in the push-up and this one does just that and it's called the rolling squat push-up now yeah and this serves more as a good combination movement that's more of a conditioning combination but the fact is it does allow us to engage those muscles if you're not doing them at all right now what we can do though beyond that is something called the TKE push-up and this is a little bit interesting you see what you do is you take your feet and your anchor them on something high a higher surface in this case my boxes and then as I'm pushing out of this push-up I'm allowing the legs to drive me see I'm not focused on necessarily pushing through the hands even though they obviously are pushing down to the ground I'm actually extending my body up by extending my knee by pushing down into that box I can't move or overcome that box but it forces my leg to extend and we know that in the extension causes quad contraction so the quad contraction is what's really driving me up here and I will tell you this I don't care how strong your quads are if you do 15 or 20 of these your quads will be burning and you might be even a little bit embarrassed to admit it but it does do the job and then we wrap up this tour around our body we can't forget to hit the most important area that's the central station for everything that's our core and to do this we've got to introduce a couple exercise variations but the first one here is the cliffhanger push-up and what we do is we extend our hands out in front of us with our fingers down onto the ground and once our hands past the level of our head the feeling that we get here completely changes now the entire front side core musculature 8 on fire we have to now try to lift the entire weight of our body off of the floor and this is where that really strong core challenge comes in and then finally we have that slightly more doable variation for our core and this is the Black Widow nice slide so we get in position here we perform our push up and as we come up we get this bottom up rotation of the knee heading towards the opposite elbow and in order to get the core activated even more we have to drive and slide that knee up as high as we can which creates this posterior pelvic tilt more flexion in the trunk more AB engagement so you can see that there's so many oh my god got a great brain by the way I've been dude coming up with great push-up variations you remember yeah what do you got oh so you remember my floor pull floor pull-ups remember how great those were dude this is even better look it's a pull push-up you know you should do with that pole what you just stick it okay you want me to go you can leave really that's not a good variation guys you can see with the right variations here that there's actually a lot of benefit you can take to your push-up workouts so that you can hit a lot more muscle groups than maybe you thought of in the beginning it's not just about chest triceps and shoulders if you're looking for our program guys where we show you everything to do step by step without
