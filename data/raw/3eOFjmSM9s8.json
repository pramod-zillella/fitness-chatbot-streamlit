    "transcript": "What's up, guys?! Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. The muscle marker is back. For those that have been asking for it. My own markers come out in my videos, and\nasking for them? Here they are. I'm going to show you a way to hit your rear\ndelts to train them, and build them with just on exercise. It all revolves around the anatomy of the\nrear delt, and how it actually works. That's why the muscle marker is out. Thankfully, I didn't have to draw this. I got a little help from Jessie, but when\nwe see people train the rear delts we see them, all the time, do this reverse fly. They're doing what is called horizontal abduction. Moving the arm back this way. The thing is, that is not necessarily the\nbest way to train the rear delts. You don't even get maximum shortening of the\nrear delt that way. you're better off getting this movement, which\nis transverse extension. In other words, an extension of the arm back,\nbehind the body, in this plane. Like that. Now, look at the difference. I'll do it again. When I do a reverse fly you can see a certain\nlevel of shortening of that muscle. From here, back to there. Now, when I come up, if I do transverse extension\ninstead, here you can see that muscle is shortened more substantially. Now why is that? Well, we're also getting this little rotation\nof the arm, into external rotation. I'm going to tell you why that's a very important\npoint, but more importantly, I'm going to show you how to do it with one exercise. When you come over here you can take a lighter\ndumbbell...and I stress �lighter' because when you train directly, your rear delt, do\nit on shoulder day, and make sure you're doing it. We know we go in there and bang out our front\nraises, we press, we do side raises, and then we leave the gym and forget about the rear\ndelts because, �who the hell cares? We can't see them anyway.' Well, we do care, and we want to see them. So what we do is, we grab the lighter dumbbells,\nwe lean forward here on a rack, you can do it on a bench, but I like to be a little bit\nmore upright for this. But we have to get bent over so we can actually\nwork against gravity, and target this muscle. Now what we do is, we do a high raise here. we're leaving the elbow...you can see the\nangle is away from the body. it's not here. Up, up, and that's a key thing. it's up, and as we come up we're going to\nsupinate the forearm here, but what we're really trying to do is externally rotate the\nshoulder. So we get up to the top, and we lift, and\nwe pull, and we squeeze. And right there, I'm telling you, if you never\ndid this exercise you're going to feel one of the most intense cramps in that rear delt,\nspecifically, because you're hitting it better than you ever had before. Why? Because that external rotation is a component\nmotion of the rear delt, and it helps you to externally rotate, and it assists the rotator\ncuff muscles to rotate here. So what we do is, we're driving up, into extension,\nas far back as we can. Get that elbow back, behind the body, but\nsquare up. If you look here, Jessie, I've got a square\ntorso here. I'm not cheating it. This stays square so I know I'm getting extension\nbehind my body. What you get is the number one key motion\nfor this muscle to hit it. Not this. Not out to the side. Back, behind you. And if we lift up, and pull the elbow, and\ndrag it back, behind us while we turn into external rotation; now we can train the muscle. Again, I'm using just 10lbs here, and I'm\nlighting up that rear delt. So now, what is another lesson that comes\nfrom this? Another lesson is, we can hit this on back\nday even more. So if it's a lagging area for you, if you\nwant to keep more volume in this area, especially doing it on back day let's us have more heavy\nvolume directed at this area. So how do you do that? Well, if you're doing a lat pull down, and\nyou're doing all your sets in this fashion, here, with the elbows heading down to train\nyour lats, in the last set what you can do is, just lean back a bit, and then let the\nelbow travel back. So it's traveling in the same way, this way,\nthis way, as I was just doing on that other exercise here. So by just leaning back a little bit, I can\nuse heavier weights, like I normally would on a lat pull down, go back that way, and\nreally train it. Now if I got underneath this way, I'm getting\nmore external rotation in the shoulders, and again I can do the same thing, and really\ntarget up, in that rear delt. Again, have your weight in a separate day\nof the week than I'm training that will allow me to have more volume. Same thing here. I could do a one arm row...again, this is\nwith more weight in my hand...and the thing is, instead of keeping the elbow tucked for\nall your sets, because that's going to be more effective for the lats...which we've\ncovered before�I want that elbow to drift, and when it drifts out to the side I lift,\nand I turn. I lift, and I turn just a little like that\nwhich gives me the unique opportunity to hit that rear delt. One other final example, you've probably felt\nthis if you ever did a seated row. If you're doing a seated row, and you're doing\nthem all with a post grip handle you probably don't feel much rear delt soreness the next\nday. But if you ever do it with a straight bar\nand you come to the top when you're doing straight bar rows you're getting exactly that\nelevated position of the elbow, and drilling that posterior delt intensely. So you will feel it the next day. So guys, that is how you hit your rear delts. Now I've given you other exercise too...the\nW raise, and things like that...that incorporate external rotation into it, but some people\ndon't necessarily have that level of strength in their rotator cuff to do it. Here, all you need to do is follow what I\nsaid. Do this with that smaller dumbbell, and that\nlighter weight, with a more focused contraction on shoulder training day, or when you do train\nyour shoulders, and then on back day, or pull day start loading on a little bit more, or\nincorporate some additional sets the way I showed you. All right, guys. Stop ignoring the rear delt. It matters just as much as all the other ones,\nand it balances out your physique, and we never overlook anything here at ATHLEANX. That is the key, and I certainly don't do\nit in any of our programs either because all of these muscles are important. They all have a role, and they all function\nto keep your whole body healthy. Head to ATHLEANX.com right now. Get one of our programs. Use the program selector beneath this video\nand you'll be able to pick the program that's best suited to your current goal. All of them, though, will follow the same\nprinciple where we always try to put the science back in what we do so you understand it better,\nand know how, and why you're doing what you're doing. All right, guys. I'll be back here again soon. Leave your comments and thumbs up. Let me know what you want me to cover in a\nfuture video, and I'll do my best to do that for you in the days, and weeks ahead. See you."
