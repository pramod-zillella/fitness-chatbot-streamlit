    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM. We're going to continue our Finisher Series\nhere today with an Ab Workout Finisher. Now, some of you might be thinking, 'Isn't\nthe whole ab workout a finisher? I mean, it starts burning in the beginning\nand it doesn't end until I'm done.' But not necessarily. We can actually place a higher demand on our\nabs if we place a different demand on our abs when they're already fatigued. That's the concept of a Finisher. So, today, what I'm going to do is show you\na series of drills that you can do. You can do this perfectly in your own home\nbecause all you'll need is a wall to finish off your abs the right way. So, let's say you've just done your ab workout\nand if you're looking for ab workouts guys, there's no shortage of them at ATHLEANX.COM. In all of our ATHLEANX Training systems you\nactually get access to unlimited ab workouts because of our ab workout shuffle feature\nthat comes with the purchase of your program You'll find that at ATHLEANX.COM. And there's plenty of ab workouts that we\nplace here for you on this channel. But you've done that, and you're now looking\nfor the way to end it. You're going to position yourself right here\non the floor up against the wall. We call it a Wall Plant Plank. Now, right off the bat you should notice this\nis much harder than a regular Plank because you don't have the benefit of having 4 points\nof contact with the ground, 2 forearms and 2 feet. Instead, you've got the wall acting as your\nonly other point of contact besides your 2 forearms. And the only way you're going to derive enough\nstrength to hold yourself up is to push your feet as hard as you possibly\ncan into that wall, a much harder task than simply balancing on your toes in a Plank. But of course, you guys know we don't just\nstop there. We're going to make it more difficult. So, your challenge is, can you make it through\neach succession of movements here without allowing your feet to drop? First up is our Cross Knee Plank that you're\ngoing to try to get 10 reps of on each leg, and then try to maintain a 30 second hold\non the Wall Plant Plank. You can see this is not very easy. Again, you've got to do the Cross Knee first. We're getting some rotation of the abs, and\nthen back to trying to stick our feet into that wall and prevent our knees from touching. If you succeed here, you move on to the next\nround. The next round is the Toe Touch Plank. This is a Cross Knee, Cross Leg variation\nas well, but of course, the only thing we're allowing\nto touch the ground is that toe, and nothing else. You cross over 10 times to each side and guess\nwhere you're going? Back to that Wall Plant Plank again and see\nif you can hold for 30 more seconds. If you succeed through the second round, you've\ngot one more left and this is a bitch. This is our Jack Plank. You're basically doing Jumping Jacks from\na Plank position. Something new all the time here, guys, on\nthis channel. You want to see if you can go through 10 Jumping\nJacks out and in, out and in,10 times, and then once again, be able to hold that 30 second\nWall Plant Plank. Guys, this is not easy, but nothing worth\nhaving ever is. If you're looking to change your body, you've\ngot to challenge yourself. I've got programs, I've got workouts here,\nall designed to do just that. This is not the place to come if you want\nto train easy. But this is the place to come if you want\nto see results. Guys, like I said, over at ATHLEANX.COM, we\nhave all the programs able to deliver those results to you that you're expecting. And in the meantime, if you like this video\nand you like this series, make sure you leave your comments and your thumb's up below. Whatever else you want to see, make sure you\nleave it below and I will bring it to you here in the coming weeks at ATHLEANX. Thanks guys."
