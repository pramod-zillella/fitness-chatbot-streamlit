    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere. \nAthleanx.com. And Jesse.   Thank you, I'm so glad you're in this video, \nbecause we're talking about I can't get my   arms to grow, what do I do? So this is Mr. I Can't \nGet My Arms to Grow. I don't know about that. All   right. Enough. You see, this is just showing off \nthat tattoo again. He's trying to get his money's   worth after that bad Disney tattoo on the other \nshoulder. All right, so today, let's say you're in   the same position though. Jesse certainly did have \na hard time building his arms, right? But we've   been working on that by having him focus on the \nsame things I'm going to have you focus on today,   and that is getting stronger in your arm \nexercises. And you may not even be doing   arm exercises, right? You were doing what? I was \nreally focusing on my leg exercises, actually.   Trying to build my quads. And obviously, as you \ncan see here, it's been working. Your legs have   been getting a lot bigger. But, I will say one of \nthe biggest mistakes people make is thinking that   just doing the heavier compound lifts is enough \nto maximize your arm size. While it will help,   heavy Roman will build your build your biceps, \nright? Heavy pull-ups will build your biceps.   Heavy benching will build your triceps. It's not \nenough to get your arms as big as they can be.   And that's what I want you guys to focus on today. \nSo what we're going to do is break down these   areas here, five of them, that I promise you if \nyou follow what I'm saying here are going to add   size to your arms regardless of how hard you \nmight think it is right now. And so if you   want to get bigger arms, the best place to start \nis by simply making sure you're performing both   ends of every single repetition you're going on \nevery exercise. We're talking about not skipping   the eccentric because that is where a lot of the \ngains can be had. If you look at the basic curl,   we know that we're lifting the weight up, but \nit's also just as important to focus on slowing   it down on the way down. Because eccentrically, \nthere's a lot of opportunity here for growth.   The beauty about focusing on the eccentric during \na curl or any pulling exercise is that you have a   built-in safety factor. If I get too tired to \nbe able to control the weight on the way down,   it's simply just going to be dropped down to \nthe floor. It's not going to come crashing   down on top of me like it would, let's say, in a \nbench press. So I could allow for a little bit of   extra momentum concentrically when I'm getting \nfatigued and still have the ability to control   eccentrically a few more repetitions to push it \njust where we need to, to create that overloading   growth. Or I could do this, and this is something \nI included in my Sore in Six Workout for biceps.   It's just an adaptive curl. I perform the \ninitial concentric from a seated position.   And then to take advantage of the fact that I have \nmore in me at a higher capacity eccentrically then   I just go back into this inclined position where \nI can have a longer excursion, a greater stretch,   more eccentric overload, and I continue to \npush myself even further for more gains.   Now we don't have to leave the triceps out \neither. We have a great opportunity to do   this with a lying tricep extension. Because we \nhave a couple things happening here. Number one:   we have a greater effect on the long head of \nthe triceps because we're putting our arms in a   greater position for a stretch. So that gives us \nthat better opportunity for eccentric overload.   But if we get too tired here, and we can't do \nthis anymore, we also have an adaptation here,   and that's simply to sort of cheat yourself \nback to an easier version of the exercises,   which would be a close group bench press. And \nthen once we get to the top concentrically,   then we lower back down again as we traditionally \nwould on the lying tricep extension. So there's   some obvious places here, guys, to eccentrically \noverload. You just have to make sure that you're   not forgetting to do it. Remember, half the \nrepetition, guys, is still half the repetition.   So now while eccentric focused training allows us \nto use those heavier weights, and at the same time   create that additional overload to create new \nsize, that doesn't mean that if we want to go more   strict in our repetition in our form that we have \nto sacrifice the ability to use relatively heavy   weights. Take a look here at the strict curl. See, \nthis requires that you put your back and your butt   up against the wall, and you do not allow \nthem to leave at any point during your curl.   This is a great opportunity here to force the \nwork to be performed strictly by the biceps,   right? We're not allowing any momentum, but it \ndoesn't mean that we can't still have a relatively   heavy load. Yes, it's less than what you can \ncurl, but it still is a great load on the biceps,   particularly here, because the biceps are handling \nall of that load. And we can take the same   principles and apply that to the triceps with this \nincline overhead double extension. You simply lay   back against an inclined bench and anchor your \nback to that bench throughout the entire rep.   The same as a strict curl, you're not going to \nallow yourselves to lean forward and gain momentum   to try to get that dumbbell up. You have to rely \non the strength purely of the triceps to do that.   So with that back firmly planted up against the \nbench, you want to get those elbows slightly out   in front of your body to protect your shoulders, \nand then simply extend your elbows as far out as   they can. The goal is to once again use as heavy \na dumbbell as you can to perform this exercise   to cause that growth and force the new \ngrowth that's not occurring right now,   but not to divert from the form restrictions that \nwe put in place by making this more strict version   of the overhead dumbbell tricep extension. And \nwe could do one more thing as well. I like this,   it's just an overhead push away modified. You \nsee, I've shown this before. A lot of people   perform this exercise and then use a lot of body \nsway in order to get that rope out away form the   body. But again, if we want to make sure that the \ntriceps are doing the work and still be able to   handle a relatively heavy load, we would want \nto get our arms up as high as we possibly can.   Because what's going to happen here is \nif you try to utilize any type of cheat,   and you allow yourself to bend backwards in \npreparation of leaning forward, you're going to   lose the stability through your core and probably \nwind up falling backwards. So you keep your arms   up high and simply look to extend the elbows with \njust the brute force and strength of your triceps.   All right, so the next thing you want to do \nwhen you want to build bigger arms is you   want to make sure you're training your \nbrachialis. And you've probably said,   I've heard that before. It's that muscle that \nlies underneath the biceps, got to push it up.   Yes, but you got to make sure you're training \nyour brachialis heavy. Because perhaps here   more than any other muscle of your arm you \nhave the opportunity to train with heavier   exercises because it's not just the brachialis \nthat works. It is a primary elbow flexer,   but we also get help from the biceps, and we \nalso get help from the brachialis. So you want to   take advantage of the fact that those muscles are \nworking synergistically to give you the chance to   lift more. So don't just relegate these exercises \nto the end of your workouts. Like a hammer curl,   a lot of people will say, I'm just going to do a \nfew sets after I've done all of my primary bicep   work. But if arm size is your problem right now, \nyou better start from the inside and work out,   and that's where the brachialis becomes your main \nfocus. So instead of just grabbing those light   weights, try to lift heavier and heavier weights, \nform repetitions in the five to eight rep range   on an exercise like that. And don't forget that \nit's not just relegated to the curling exercises.   One of the best ways to build the muscles of your \nupper arm is with an exercise like the pull-up.   Yes, you're going to hit the brachialis here, \nand yes, you're going to hit the brachioradialis,   which we're going to come back to in a second. \nBut just doing so and utilizing your body weight,   which is a great form of overload. But the \npoint is, brachialis, yes. But are you training   brachialis hard enough and heavy enough? Probably \nnot. Which brings us to another important point,   and that is you don't want to use your body \nweight exercises as simply burnout exercises.   Because they're capable of so much more if you \njust realize that you can load that. So you can   take an exercise like the chin-up and simply \nthrow a weighted vest on and now you've got an   opportunity for tension overload to force new \nmuscle growth as opposed to simple just adding   repetitions to a weight you can already handle. \nMetabolic stress is a way to build muscle,   but if you're at a dead end right now, \nyou're likely not creating enough tension,   and this gives us a chance. And you don't have \nto have a weighted vest. One of my favorite ways   is to simply utilize a dog leas for your dip belt, \nand you're off and running. Now we could take   this to another exercise entirely because maybe \nchin-ups just isn't your thing. And this is the   inverted chin curl. Essentially what we do is we \ntake another body weight exercise, throw that vest   on, and overload it, and we've got a body weight \nversion of a curl. You see, instead of curling   the bar up to your body, you're basically curling \nwith your body to the bar with the elbows in that   same end position. Bent at around 90 degrees, and \nagain, elevated slightly into shoulder flection   to insure that you're getting a good peak bicep \ncontraction. But it's not limited just to biceps.   We have so many different things we could do for \nthe triceps. Lots of different push-up variations.   One of my favorites is the tricep cobra push-up. \nAnd this here, again, can utilize that weighted   vest or someone can simply push down on your back \nif you're not training with any equipment at all,   but you have a partner around to create additional \noverloading force that you have to push through   that takes that ordinary burnout exercise that \nyou were relegating it to and create something   that's capable of delivering new muscle \ngrowth. Which brings me to my next point,   and that is if you want to get bigger arms, you \nrealize that arm size doesn't just stop here,   but it goes down here too. And we need to fill \nin the gap with this muscle right here that   I mentioned called the brachioradialis. The good \nnews is we have a lot of ways that we can train it   effectively. In order to do this, we need to \nhave that muscle get into a pronated position   to discourage a contribution of the biceps and \nthe brachialis to the move. The more pronated,   the more this muscle will do the work. And \nwe can also do this by getting our elbows   flexed as much as we possibly can. So the first \nplace we could actually turn is an odd exercise,   but it works really, really well, and it utilizes \na lap pull down machine. You can see that by   having my arms up in this position, I can get a \nfully pronated hands down grip on the bar, and   then when I bend my elbows, I don't get stopped by \nmy chest like I would with a normal reverse curl.   I could take that elbow flection back even further \nbehind my head so I get a bigger excursion,   more range of motion, more load, and more growth. \nBut if we want to stick to the more traditional   options, we have a couple choices. The first \nis the offset dumbbell curl. And by offsetting   the hand here, we actually get an overload into \npronation. Right, remember I said that pronation   is part of what this muscle does. So as we curl \nup and flex the elbow, we have to overload that   pronation and overcome the pronation to get there. \nSo we give ourselves a chance to focus the load   a little bit more on that brachioradialis and away \nfrom the brachioradialis and biceps. If you want   to take this even a little bit more traditionally, \nthen we can just simply use an easy curl bar.   But instead of going completely face down \nlike this in a fully pronated position,   we now cheat it a little bit up, a little bit \nmore to the supinated grip with the purpose being   that you want now the additional help from the \nbiceps so that you can handle more load. Look,   being in this neutral to somewhat pronated \nposition is always going to be more of a   brachioradialis exercise. But because we have a \nlittle bit more help, we can increase that load,   and if the tension overload is what you're looking \nfor, that is the way you're going to want to get   it. And with those guys, you have a game plan now \nto start attacking the size of your arms. Get them   larger, guys, both the biceps and the triceps.
