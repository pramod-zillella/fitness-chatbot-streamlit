    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today I’m going to talk about the best exercises\nfor your chest. However, there’s a catch. That is, we can only use this. Some dumbbells. I realize there are some exercise options\nthat would be really, really helpful if we had a barbell, but that’s not the game here. As a matter of fact, this isn’t even a fantasy\nland scenario because a lot of times guys out there that don’t have a lot of training\nspace find themselves training with just dumbbells. What I want to do is provide you with the\nbest options for that. Now, we’ve covered other videos in this\nseries. Namely, we did the shoulders that you’re\ngoing to want to check out here. The idea there is, I need at least some context. If I’m going to play this game and make\nthe best selections for you, I need to know what we’re trying to train for. So just like we did in that video, we’re\ngoing to cover the best options for strength, power, hypertrophy, metabolic overload, a\ntotal body option, a corrective option, and then one that doesn’t really fit any of\nthese categories in the case of the chest by trying to address the lack of adduction\nthat we have when we’re strapped with dumbbells as our only implement. But don’t worry, guys. I’ve got you covered there as well. So, let’s get it started, guys. We’re going to break it down, one by one,\nright here. First, with strength. So, we kick it all off with strength, the\ngoal being progressively overloading the exercises that we’re doing. Now, we know if we had access to a barbell\nit would be a lot easier because we could take the barbell bench-press, which should\nbe a staple exercise option here if you have access, but we don’t. That’s not the rules of the video. What we have here is, we need to substitute. Look, before we make a jump to the dumbbell\nvariation of a bench-press, I want to show you something else. Here’s the weighted dip. It’s an exercise I like to use for progressively\noverloading the chest as well. Of course, we’re involving some other muscles\nas well. But I can favor the chest by leaning forward\nmore and making sure I keep my shoulder blades down, and back. Now, what happens when we make the substitution. If I go from a barbell bench to a dumbbell\nbench-press I run into a little bit of a problem. I’m never going to be able to press, on\nan equal basis, what I could with a barbell once I split those hands up and have dumbbells\nin each hand. The requirements of stability are normally\nwhat are going to undermine our ability to press with as much strength as you have. You can see that you’ve probably experienced\nthat firsthand as you’ve tried to correlate a move from a barbell bench-press, to a dumbbell\nbench-press. Let’s reevaluate that dip. I believe there’s a great opportunity here. We can take the weight that we load up here\n– which was plates – and replace them with dumbbells. I use a dog leash here. It’s a simple, no excuses way to do this. You can see me wrapping the dog leash around\nand through the handle, around the dumbbell, and then to itself. Now you’ve got a perfectly weighted dip\nbelt of any weight. It doesn’t matter what I’m using. Whether I’m using plates or dumbbells, the\nability to carry this exercise over from a plated option to a dumbbell option is a lot\ncloser than what you’d expect than going from a barbell bench, to a dumbbell bench. So, for that reason, I love the weighted dip. It still gives you the chance to continue\nto add a slightly heavier dumbbell, keep the progressive overload coming, and keep those\nstrength gains coming. So, the goal of these strength exercise selections\nwas one that you could progressively overload with the most weight and push as much weight\nas possible on – we need to do something different here when we’re talking about\npower. That is a speed component. What exercise could you move as quickly as\npossible without having to sacrifice the weight, to a level that would be insignificant? Well, if I had my Druthers, I’d do this. This is a sled push away that I had Antonio\nBrown do. There’s a key factor going on here that\nwe want to try and emulate and bring across to our dumbbell selected exercise because\nit’s critical for maximizing power development. That is the ability to release the load that\nwe’re trying to accelerate. If I were to take a dumbbell and bring it\nto a dumbbell bench-press and just try to move it as quickly as possible, as we reach\nfull extension with those dumbbells, we’re decelerating right at the end of each rep. That’s exactly the opposite if what you\nwant to do if you’re trying to maximize force development. They decelerate because they have to get on\ntheir back and allow us to get back in the position to perform the next rep. However, we can take something very similar\nto what we did with the sled push away and translate it to a dumbbell exercise, not even\nusing the dumbbells in our hands, simply as targets. That is the plyo-tap that you see here. Here, we’re using our bodyweight as a resistance. Trust me, this is not an easy exercise. If you choose dumbbells that are heavy enough,\nthe height of those dumbbells will increase higher and higher because of the additional\nweight on those dumbbells. That makes you have to push off the ground\nharder and harder. More forcefully, more explosively, faster. Again, I tell you this is not an easy exercise. You have to push with a lot of force. You are not hindered, however, by having to\nhold anything. You push your body away from the ground with\nthe roof as your only limitation – which I don’t think you’re going to be hitting\n– and the key here is that you perform them to a submaximal level. Don’t take these all the way to failure. Leave a couple in the tank but maximize the\nforce and speed with which you push, and I promise you the best gains from this exercise. Now we move onto hypertrophy. Trying to build bigger muscles. Look, you’ve probably heard at some point\nthat you don’t need to get sore in order to build big muscles. While that is absolutely true, at some point\nyou’re going to have to because you’re going to dry up with how much weight you can\ncontain a load to the bar. Metabolic training alone – which we’re\ngoing to talk about – is going to, at some point, become limited in its ability to overload\nyour muscles because of the lighter weights that you use to perform those exercises. So, at some point, to continue the growth\nand the gains coming, you’re going to need to explore an eccentrically overloaded exercise\noption. That is why I want to load you and arm you\nwith the right one. This one right here is the eccentric floor\nfly. What we’re doing is trying to eccentrically\noverload the chest. We can do that with a fly. However, as I’ve said many, many times before,\nto protect the health of our shoulders, we don’t want to unnecessarily have to get\nup onto a bench to perform the exercise. We could perform it on the floor and have\nthe floor act as our safety net. The great thing is though, because we know\nwe have a safety net for our shoulders, we can do this exercise with a lot heavier weight\nthan we might usually use when we do a bench version of this. You’ve probably heard people tell you “Don’t\ngo ahead of me on the fly and you’ll be okay”. How about, if we want to go heavy to create\nmore eccentric overload? Don’t worry about the fact that you’re\nnot flying back to the top. We’ll cover the adduction in our later exercise\nselections. Get to the top and overload, and lower slowly\non every rep. Cheat the positive back up to the top by altering\nthe position of your arms, and this exercise will be an absolute winner for you when it\ncomes to creating that eccentric muscle damage, and ultimately, more growth. So, I just mentioned metabolic training as\nan option for building more muscle. However, it does require that you change your\nmind set a little bit because you can do this with a lot lighter weights. As a matter of fact, you have to do this with\nlighter weights. But the important factor here is that you\nknow what to do with those light weights. Light weights alone will not cut it. Light weights with an applied stress, meant\nto increase metabolic stress instead of your muscles is how you do it. So, you’ll see I choose the dumbbell bench-press. It doesn’t matter whether or not you choose\nthe incline bench-press or the flat bench-press, as I’ll show you in a couple seconds, it’s\nhow you do the exercise that matters the most. To do this we want to revel in the burn. Find the burn and then figure out a way to\nrevel in it, swim in it, stay there for as long as possible. That’s what creates the spark for protein\nsynthesis. How do we do it? Well, we perform this ladder style. Perform a single repetition of the bench-press\nand then pause for a single second at the bottom of the rep. Then do another repetition and then hold for\ntwo seconds in the most difficult portion of the rep. If you continue to add one second to the hold\non every, single repetition performed you’ll start to burn, at some point, pretty quickly. The key here is how long you can withstand\nit. I’m telling you guys, if you give in too\nsoon, you’re going to lose the benefits of this training. Again, I mentioned when it comes to metabolic\ntraining, how you perform them and how intense you’re able to stay within that exercise\nis what matters the most. This next one is a little bit more challenging. That’s our total body exercise selection. How the hell are you going to train your whole\nbody when you’re training your chest? Some people might be thinking right off the\nbat “I guess a burpee could do it”, but the fact of the matter is, I think you have\na better option. Especially if you look at it in a different\nway. I’m not always trying to find the exercise\nthat I can load maximally. I’m trying to find the exercise that I consider\ntotal body, that I can have a maximum effect and impact on as many areas of my body as\npossible. For that, I use the bench press-up. What we’re trying to do here is more on\nthe lighter side of the weight. It’s not about the weight we’re using. It’s about the requirements of our body\nto perform. You’ll see very easily here that I need\nto be able to not only perform an incline bench-press, but I need to be able to have\nthoracic mobility to keep those dumbbells up overhead. Think very similar to a Turkish getup. The Turkish getup is not necessarily programmed\nfor any one, specific purpose, but it’s a great exercise for training our entire body\nhow to get off the ground, and utilize, and synchronize the different segments to do that\nmost efficiently. We’re doing that here with the bench press-up. I’m trying to get the dumbbells up overhead\nand then sit up while maintaining as much thoracic extension as possible. If you see those dumbbells caving forward,\neither you don’t have the ability to do the exercise at all, which means you need\nto work on your thoracic mobility a lot, or you’ve chosen too heavy of a weight. Remember, it’s not about the weight here. When I get into that position there is one\nother thing I can do. If I want to take it to another level and\ntake it to one other segment I would try to stand at this point. Again, we know that standing from this position,\nstanding from a seated position is very similar to standing as you would from the bottom of\nan overhead squat. And the criteria and requirements for the\nthoracic spine to be able to do that properly become even more difficult. The idea here is, as a total body option,\nyou are training your chest, but more so, you’re reinforcing some mobility and requirements\nthat are going to benefit you in other areas of your training. Now we move onto our corrective exercise,\nguys. The corrective exercises, just because they’re\nsmall, they’re no less important. As a matter of fact, here, once again, like\nwe do with power we’re not using the dumbbells for an exercise or overload. We’re using them as an implement, or tool\nto accomplish something else. That is a stretch on the pec minor. You’re probably saying to yourself “Who\ncares about the pec minor? I only want to develop my pec major.” Guys, your pec minor is a very important muscle\nbecause what it tends to do is get tightened and short. When it does it could cause compression and\nthoracic atlas syndrome, that leads to neurological and vascular issues down your arm – tingling\n– things you do not want to bring to your training at any point in time, or in your\nevery day life. So, we want to stretch this muscle out because\nwhen it gets tight it tends to bring your shoulders up and forward. We know from the posture videos we’ve done,\nthat’s not something that’s very desirable. So, what we do is position ourselves on a\nfoam roller with a very light set of dumbbells. I start by having my arms overheard and squeezing\nmy shoulder blades back down, and around. What I can do is get that retraction and that\ndepression of the shoulder blades. At that point I lift my arms up, out to the\nside, and allow the dumbbells to sink lower than the elbow. That creates external rotation at the shoulder. Yes, once again, I’ve used that word ‘external\nrotation at the shoulder’ because it’s so damn important. If we combine these together, we’re getting\na nice stretch on the pec minor that we just want to hang out here for. Allow the weights to let you sink into that\nstretch. Try to stay here for 45 seconds or so. If you want to do these two or three times,\neven better. But you’ll find that it really starts to\nloosen up your upper chest. And more importantly, starts to help reposition\nthose shoulders back and down where they belong. Last, but not least, we have our miscellaneous\ncategory. It doesn’t really fit in any specific category,\nbut they’re no less important and helpful to you. When it comes to the chest what we’re really\ntrying to do is come up with exercise options with dumbbells that allow us to adduct the\narm. To take our arm fully across midline. We realize that the main exercises we use,\nlike the dumbbell bench-press, or dips, or even a pushup aren’t necessarily allowing\nus to do any of that. In order to get full chest activation, we’ve\ncovered many times that we need to be able to get that hand and arm across the center\nof our body. You might think “The chest fly. He’s going to go back to the fly again.” Well, I already said I don’t like the fly\non a bench, but we’re not going to use the fly on the floor here because as you see,\nyou get limited to how far across the body you can get. At best, you’re getting to midline. Even at the top there, you’re not under\nresistance. So, we have some other options. The first of which is this. This is called the dumbbell UCV raise. The idea here is to get that arm from the\nlow and away position, up and across your body. You’ll notice that it follows the fiber\ndirection of the upper chest. Knowing that the fibers run from the clavicle\ndown, and out toward your arm. So, if you could ‘follow the fibers’,\nas we always talk about here, we can get good chest activation. As a bonus, upper chest activation by bringing\nour arm up, and across our body. You can see how hard of a contraction we can\nachieve here. This is not about using a heavy, heavy weight. It’s about achieving that contraction, that\nfull chest contraction, by virtue of getting to full adduction in the exercise. We have another option here, too. We can take a low approach. The low approach is holding the dumbbell down\nat our side and shrugging up and across our body, so the dumbbell ends across and equal\nwith the other pec. That’s going to allow us to get the same\nsensation, feeling it more from the bottom up. The fact is still that we’re getting adduction\nacross midline with a dumbbell in a way that allows us to overload one of the key functions\nof the chest in the process. So, there you go, guys. There are the best dumbbell exercises you\ncan do for your chest and I’ve even given you some criteria and context on which to\nperform them. Guys, it matters how you train. It matters what you’re training for. If you’re looking for a program that lays\nit all out step by step, we’ll show you how to take whatever it is you’re training\nfor and get you there the fastest, and safest way possible.
