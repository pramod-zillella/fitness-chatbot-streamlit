    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we continue our perfect workout series this time the perfect workout to lose weight and oh yes there is one that does exist or at least as close to perfect that we can get here in this series now we talk about losing weight you can't continue this discussion without first talking about nutrition and a lot of us don't want to hear about it but it always is about calories in and calories out the calories in portion is significant as a matter of fact I always say you can't out train a bad diet so you got to get serious about what you're eating that being said though I know you're here because you want to talk about the calories out portion what you can do to burn calories while you're in the gym how can you get to that hypocaloric state well that's where we need to start talking here because a lot of times what people wind up doing are things that are not nearly as efficient or effective for the time that they're spending in the gym and we can fix that here with this perfect workout so a lot of us will go to the gym we'll either do a lot of this just sort of line normally boring cardio or we may even do something a little bit more athletic and try to do this the jumping jack representative of some type of metabolic exercise the problem is this right here is too low on the intensity scale to be really worth it or effective in the long run because this is actually only going to burn about five to six calories per minute not really going to get a lot of bang for your buck even if you do this for a long period of time on the opposite end of the spectrum here you could do something like this because you maybe even saw one of the videos that Jesse and I did where I put him through the torture and I had them do the Burpee and the Burpee is actually going to be able to burn 15 calories per minute on average everything's relative to the size of the person and the fitness level of the person doing it but on average 15 calories per minute making it one of the most effective exercises for burning calories but how long are you going to sustain a minute after minute after minute of burpees likely not very long so your ability to sustain the exercise is going to be critical to keep this going and have a massive impact on your desire here to lose weight the second part of it here is most often the workouts that are done completely ignore the contribution of resistance training to the workout we're not going to make the same stay here as a matter of fact it's going to play an integral role in what we do to create the workout all right so what are we supposed to be doing well here's where the first surprise comes in this video and that is I'm actually not going to just give you one workout I'm gonna give you a week of workouts I want to make sure that I leave no stone unturned because I know that this is an issue that a lot of you out there are dealing with and I want to give you the exact step-by-step gameplan to make sure you see the results from doing this and we start with actually a leg workout that's gonna fit into a perfect push-pull legs set up here with the goal being to lose weight so why are we choosing the legs to start because I want to illustrate a major point and it goes back to what I just talked about about the effectiveness and the importance of the resistance training exercise it's sort of leading the way and we start here with a barbell squat and you're probably telling yourself wait a second this does not look at all like any weight loss workout I've used in the past and my answer is I know and that's probably why you might still be looking for one because this is going to be more of a long-term solution for you so how do we load this we load this actually in a much heavier weather you might expect we go for a 70% to 80% load of your one rep max 10 repetitions for 10 sets after every single set you're gonna rest one minute this is a traditional German volume training approach now why is this work well we go to a study recently published here that showcases the caloric expenditure of these resistance training exercises and again why they're so important in what we're doing here you can see that at a much lower intensity level the squat is still capable of burning 10 pallars which instantly makes it better than what the traditional jumping jack would give us and it again would be far more sustainable than a Burpee although at a less of a calorie expenditure that's ok because we know that we can increase the intensity level as I said up to the 70 or in this case it was used at an 80% max the fact is now we're all of a sudden jumping up significantly to about a 30 3.2 calories burn per minute at this effort level why is that look even if you don't agree entirely the accuracy of that number which I have some questions it certainly isn't down at 10 calories the reason why it's much higher is that the effort level to do this is far more significant we're trying to burn calories guys again he want to maximize how much effort you exert but still make it sustainable and the beauty of German volume training is that it's going to ally to be sustainable you can do this I've done it myself as a matter of fact we programmed it in one of our programs max size that allows us to do this the secondary benefit though of this exercise and all the exercises in the leadoff spot here is you're also getting muscle building benefits and the more muscle you can build the more calories you'll be going to be able to burn in an ongoing basis because the tissue is going to be more metabolically demanding even at rest so we do this and then we move on to the second half of the workout and the second half actually is going to pair up once again one of those resistance training exercises with one of the more typical metabolic conditioning exercises so here's what this one will look like you're gonna do 40 seconds of this push-up renegade row again it's sort of a push up into a pull a push into a pull we're gonna do this for 40 seconds in a one-minute period meaning you get 20 seconds rest then you immediately go into this next exercise here the more metabolic conditioning movement here and this is the high effort mountain climber and notice I didn't say just a mountain climber because mountain climbers can look like this this is not very effective you look like you're doing something but you don't look like you're really working that hard for this to be more effective guys I want you to bust it for 30 seconds as hard as you possibly can the idea here is you do 30 seconds of work but you get 30 seconds of rest before you have to go back into that resistance training exercise so you go back and forth here 10 rounds of each exercise meaning you're gonna do this for 20 more minutes in total this workout will take you just about 37 to 40 minutes that's it there's no long-distance cardio haven't be done here there's no boring stuff being done here your effort level is high enough without being too high to still allow us to be sustainable that's day one where do you go from here well let's actually go back a day because when we schedule this all out you're gonna see that we're going to lead off the week with our push workout but I wanted to set the groundwork because I want to illustrate a very important point for the push workout today our exercise of choice to kick it off for our main resistance training exercise is the barbell bench press and again working about the 70 or 80% max for 10 sets of 10 in between once again here you can be resting for a full minute now how many calories does this exercise burn obviously a lot less than it does when you're training your legs this is going to give you about twelve point four calories burned at that resistance level but keep in mind we're going to be resting here in between so if you average it out you're actually gonna be only getting about a six point two calories per minute burn well you might be thinking yourself Jeff that's not much better than the jumping jack that was five or six calories you're right what's the jumping jack had none of the benefits that this exercise is going to provide for building muscle to get those additional long-term benefits so we're kind of playing this for the long run here while we're still setting up the rest of the workout like we did the first day and the rest of the workout looks like this there's going to be 40 seconds of the kettlebell alternating clean and lunge so we can get those legs working again here you do that for 40 seconds and then you rest for 20 seconds and then you just pick up a jump rope one of the best exercises you can possibly do when it comes to conditioning and burning calories itself at a level of around fifteen or sixteen calories per minute depending upon how intense it is that you're jumping and as I mentioned back with the mountain climbers I want you to be jumping as intensely as you can again with the ability to continue to sustain this for the duration of the workout now guys I point out here that I've said ten rounds of each meaning twenty minutes total of this second half of the workout if you're just starting out and you're finding it difficult do five rounds of each but the goal here is to work your way up to the point where you're doing ten and ten then we proceed through the workout week through the leg workout and then back here now to Friday on your pool workout and the exercise here of choice is going to be the barbell row it's similar to the benchpress it's not going to be as calorically significant of a burn as you'd get on the legs but it's going to be around thirteen point nine calories at that 80% level now again remember we're factoring in that additional minute of rest so on average you're bringing this down to about seven calories per minute but don't lose sight of those additional benefits that we're getting from the muscle building aspect now the second half of this workout will look like this you're gonna go back forty seconds of the kettlebell clean and press you're going all the way down to the floor cleaning it up putting it down all the way down to the floor opposite side clean and press a metabolically demanding exercise with that resistance training component we move on to 30 seconds of another exercise probably one of the best you can do with the kettlebell for metabolic benefit and that is the kettlebell swing so 30 seconds using a significant weight one that's going to get you to do about 20 swings or so in those 30 seconds you rest the remaining 30 seconds and you continue to repeat this all the way through until you're done with your 10 rounds of each now is that workout we complete we've hit our push we've in our legs we put our pull we still got one more we got one additional core workout and I want you to slot this in on either Saturday or Sunday or that remaining day of the week and what we're doing here is simply 10 repetitions of three different exercises as many rounds as you can in 20 minutes so as you can see guys none of these workouts are going to last longer than even 45 minutes but if you do this in just 4 workouts a week you are going to lose weight and you're gonna do it the right way here's what this workout looks like it starts with what we call a 3-way seated knee tuck you're going to bring your knees in lean back engage that core post early tilt the ABS bring your knees dead center then bring them to the right and then bring it to the left a little bit of an oblique twist to add on 10 repetitions in each direction so essentially 30 repetitions straight then you go into a squat thrusts 10 repetitions here again this becomes more of one of those metabolic conditioning exercises and then finally we tie it all together with 10 box jumps up onto the same bench or box that you started this workout from so it's very condensed in terms of how much room you need to take up in the gym that's not an excuse again as many rounds as you can you rest as needed but you're encouraged to keep this thing moving as fast as possible the fact is guys when you stream this all together here and you lay it all out as you see me doing here this becomes as close to perfect as an option for losing weight as there is out there it is far superior to allow the other things that you might be doing right now and maybe even getting frustrated over you spend your time in the gym you might be there even over an hour doing traditional cardio and it's not working for you or it works for a short period of time and then you hit a wall and you're left wanting more or you're back looking for videos like this I promise you guys the effort level is going to go up here but so will the results and if you're willing to put it in guys you're gonna find the results to come a lot more quick and that is the key here guys to make sure that you're not getting frustrated because it's taking too long to see what you want to see if you're looking for step-by-step workouts guys we have all the other workouts actually
