    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere\nathleanx.com today i'm going to show you a chest workout that's going to maximize\nyour chest development and we're going to put the science behind the decisions\nto include the exercises that we do and I'm also going to throw in the muscle\nmarker and this band to help us get the job done let's start with the band\nactually the muscle marker as well I've actually been practicing here as you can\nsee the idea here is if we take the band and we activate the chest by going into\nthis position here we see that there's a lot of things going on in terms of the\nfibers and the orientation of the fibers they're not all running in the same\ndirection matter of fact they don't even all have\nthe same attachments the fibers that originate from the upper chest here\ncoming off with the clavicle and they're running down towards the humerus right\nbut the most important thing is they're going from a high to low position\nwhereas the fibers that come off of the sternum again a different bone than the\nclavicle are actually coming in more of a horizontal direction going almost\nstraight across the chest out towards the arm and then we have the ones that\ncome off with a bottom portion here of the sternum and they head up so these\nare not going completely horizontal these are actually traveling from a low\nto a high position so we shouldn't know if you've been watching this channel\nthat in order to fully hit the chest you're going to want to choose exercises\nthat follow those fibers meaning you're going to want to take your arm through\ndifferent ranges of motion to better hit and align it with those fibers so let's\nsee what those would be well we know we got to choose the staple\nexercises we know we got to choose the exercises that allow us to load them the\nmost of the PEC gets the most capacity to be overloaded and that starts right\nhere at the bench press so as I move my arm out and a bench press the alignment\nof the arm is moving here almost parallel to these mid fibers coming off\nof the middle portion here of the sternum and that's what happens here as\nyou see on the exercise itself to hit the middle portion of the chest it's a\ngood developer of that portion of the chest okay good so the flat bench press\nobviously we know there's a reason for doing it but there's also a reason for\ndoing the incline bench press in doing it as well because that's going to take\nthe through a different position it's gonna\ntake it from a low to a high position right we go here we push up what is that\ndoing you can see that now it's taking this upper arm and aligning it more in\nparallel with the fibers going here and this high-to-low arrangement you can see\nthat once again play out as I do the exercise so so far we're two for two\nwe've got two of the bigger exercises we're able to load them up and now we've\ngot to hit the lower portion of the chest and the lower chest\nwe've probably heard is best hit with a dip why is that again it's not by\naccident it's by Anatomy you take your arm through this position of an extended\narm behind your body and it comes and it travels down and as it travels down you\ngo from this high to low position better allowing you to hit the lower fibers of\nthe chest versus the ones that run parallel and versus the ones that run\nfrom low to high so this is really what's important here is that you\nunderstand that the exercise selection is not random it's done for a reason to\ntry to take the muscle through its entire range of motion but there's a\nvery key differentiator of what I just said there you want to not just take\nthose exercises through their full range of motion you want to take the muscle\nthrough its full range of motion and that is where we need to differentiate\nand that is where we need to jump off from because all of these exercises see\nif you can tell the limitation on all of them from the flat bench press to the\nincline bench press to the dip they're not crossing midline and we know that\nthe action of the PEC at the shoulder has capability to take this arm not just\nthrough adduction but across and horizontal adduction across midline and\nall those exercises are limited by the fact that they don't take you even to\nmidline let alone across it so how would you construct a better chest workout\nwhat you'd want to do is you'd want to take those exercises and follow them\nimmediately with a drop set of an exercise that's going to do that so\nlet's go back to the flat bench press we go immediately from our flat bench press\nhere to a horizontal cable cross over now that again people might even say -\nthere's a lot of fans in the cable crossover saying that it's a better\nchest activator from EMG studies then what a flat bench press is doing but\nguys if you rely on energy studies and you wind up saying things like that and\ndon't understand that though it may have a better percentage of activation it's\nstill not capable of being loaded to the extent that a barbell bench press is\ntherefore limiting its ability to be effective it's if it's the only thing\nyou do but if you do it in addition to the bench press you're getting the\nbenefits of everything so now we take that we drop right into this horizontal\ncable crossover and we can see that we're actually now taking our arm all\nthe way through and crossing midline and getting that complete activation of the\nchest in that plane of motion so we don't have to stop there though because\nwe can do different planes of motion because this shoulder is a\nthree-dimensional joint we can hit any angle we want so if we go back now we do\nour incline bench press and when we're done with that we don't rest we\nimmediately go back over to the crossover and we change the orientation\nso that our arms can go through this low to high arc and again we're not we're\nnot going to stop where we would stop on a bench press on the incline bench press\nwhat we're going to do is we're actually going to take the arm to midline and\nthrough midline and you can see again the degree of contraction and complete\ncontraction we're getting up the chest by doing so it's a difference maker guys\nwhen you actually implement it and we're go to the dip the same thing our hands\nare actually fixed on a dip as well we can't get our hands to come towards mid\nline because the dip station just allows them to stay in one position but we can\ntake the dip we can load it up we can use weights we can do whatever we want\nto create overload with that exercise as soon as we're done we come back over\nhere and now we change the orientation of the cables once again to go from high\nto low and once again it's not just getting the midline\nbut it's crossing through midline to get a complete contraction of the chest an\nessential element for a complete chest workout and again one extra exercise\nhere I'll push up one that we do a lot I'm sure you don't have to stop with\njust the push shell because we're being limited once again by the fact that our\nhands are in contact with the ground and cannot get across our body so we use the\npush-up into this banded push-up where Ashley can come up and drive one hand\nacross the body to create an abduction across midline right one arm staying\ndown in contact with the ground the RL arm goes across of course we want to\nswitch sides and work both sides here but this is how you complete the\ndevelopment of your chest by including exercises that can be\nloaded by including exercises that take the muscle through its full range of\nmotion and of course applying full range of motion to all of the exercises even\nif they are limited in how much complete range of motion they can apply to the\nmuscle itself that is how you do it guys if you're looking for a complete workout\nthat puts this all together puts the science back in strength head to\nathleanx.com as a matter of fact we don't just train chest we train like\nathletes we try to figure out ways we can incorporate chest training into a\nmore total body explosive application of it so that we move like athletes\nfunction like athletes and look like athletes those are all over at\nathleanx.com if you found the video helpful make sure you let me know below\nif you haven't already done so guys please subscribe and make sure you turn\non your notifications so you never miss a new video that we do including the\nnext muscle marker video all right guys talk to you again soon\nsee ya you"
