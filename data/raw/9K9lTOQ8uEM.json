    "transcript": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nCalisthenics: The ultimate manifestation of   the strength and control of the human body \nin space. As a matter of fact, they are an   irreplaceable part of a complete athletic training \napproach because at some point, regardless of your   achievements in the weight room, you're going \nto have to stand on your own two feet literally   and put your body to the test in competition. \nToday, I'm ranking the top 10 best calisthenics   exercises for helping you to build muscle, and \nwhat you won't find here are exercises like this,   or this, or this. And while I have great respect \nfor those that can make these exercises look so   damn easy, they re missing some key components \nthat are actually creating the opportunity   for the muscle growth that you're seeking. \nNow, look, I'm a big fan of calisthenics myself,   incorporating them into almost every \nsingle one of my workouts. However,   even the ones you see here are not going to make \nit to the list because for the same very reasons,   they're not going to drive the muscle growth \nthat we're seeking that's relegated to the   top 10 here that I've chosen. That being said, \nlet's start breaking them down one by one. \n  And we kick the list off here with one of my \nfavorite exercises for building muscle when   it comes to the back. And no, we're not \nup to the pull up bar just yet. Instead,   we do something here called the human pullover. \nAnd what this is designed to do it again is to   overload the lats from the top to \nthe bottom, from origin to insertion   to build a better lat. And we're overloading them \nbecause we're utilizing our entire body weight.   This is not an ab driven exercise. It could be \nif you do it incorrectly. Instead of curling your   trunk up by using your abs, you drive your body \nup by pulling your arms down. Think straighter arm   push down to get your body up rather than lifting \nyour pelvis into the air using your abs. If you   do this exercise, guys, you will create overload \ninstantly because of the weight of your own body.   It's an effective exercise, albeit a hard one, \nbut it will drive muscle growth guaranteed.\n  Exercise num--Jesse, I hate these stupid \ntransitions. Can I just do it my way, please? \n  No! This is fun. \nExercise number two is another one with lat   involvement, but if you do this right, we're going \nto turn it into a great bicep building exercise   and it's a classic chin up. What's great \nabout this is it has all the components of   a bicep contraction. It's got that flexion of the \nshoulder. It's got supination here of the forearm.   And of course, it has deflection of the elbow \nas you get towards the top of the movement. But   what's key is maintaining the right relationship \nof your body to the bar. When you do the exercise,   don't get too close, as I've mentioned many times \nbefore, but maintain some distance between your   body and the bar at the top to keep the focus \nmore on the biceps and less on the lats. And   I promise you, because once again you're lifting \nyour own body weight, the overload you're seeking   is readily available, making the gains that \nyou're seeking much easier to come by. \n  Exercise number three is one of my favorite ways \nto build shoulders, even if you have access to a   full gym. Because we're talking about a \nclosed chain shoulder building exercise   using just this wall over here. It's a handstand \npush up. And what's great about this again,   I mentioned closed chain, this is one of the \nvery few opportunities you have to do a shoulder   exercise with an overhead pressing motion where \nyour hands are still in contact with the ground,   which activates the kinetic chain in a \ndifferent way. It stabilizes the scapula   differently because they're not in this open \nchain environment of pressing the bar up overhead,   and it still gives you the chance to push \nthe weight of your own body instantly,   once again creating that overload that's necessary \nto push and drive those new muscle gains. \n  Exercise number four is another one that I would \ninclude in any training program, even if I had   access to a full gym. And while we're talking \nabout it, guys, these calisthenics exercises   are those that actually should be incorporated \ninto every single training program because they   perfectly complement what it is you're trying to \ndo when you have access to weights. What's the one   we're talking about here? It's the glute hammer \nbridge you can see with this exercise. What it   does is it incorporates both hamstring activation \nand glute activation and more importantly,   ties them together in function. \nIf you can allow the glutes to drive   the function of the hamstrings by contracting \nand stabilizing first, you're going to get not   only a better contraction of the hamstrings, but \na safer one where they're not overloaded with the   responsibility that the glutes are not taking part \nin. The bottom line is this will create gains in   the size of both the hamstrings and the glutes. If \nyou perform it regularly and it's the reason why   it sits here squarely at the number four spot on \nour list of the best calisthenics exercises. \n  And that brings us to number five, the halfway \nmark on the list. One of the most classic   muscle building exercises out \nthere, and it's the pushup. \n  But Jeff, you said that pushups \nare killing my gains. \n  No, my friend, not listening is killing \nyour games. Pushups are actually okay.   Let me explain here for a second, guys. \nSo, we're talking about pushups. I've   mentioned that many times in the past why \nI like them and why don't first of all,   you got to do them right. Those last two \ninches of extension on the push up matter   if you want to get a complete chess contraction, \nbut more importantly, the variation of the pushup   matters. Don't stick to the version that you \ncan do 30, 40, 50 or a hundred reps of. Instead,   find the version that challenges you to do maybe \n10 or 15 at most, and we know that there's plenty   of variations out there. It's going to take the \nexercise that it can do many of and instantly make   it more challenging and difficult. Who cares how \nmany of you actually ultimately do, the fact is,   you create the overload that's necessary to \ndrive the muscle growth that you're seeking. \n  As room move to exercise. Number six is important \nto understand that your abs are muscles, too,   and they too can grow if you apply the right \nresistance. So, the absence of weights,   what do you do? You use the weights that you \ncarry around every day and that's your legs.   And the best way to do that is with a hanging leg \nraise. So, when we go to a hanging exercise here,   we take the weight of the legs and lift them up \nin space, which creates that necessary overload.   Remember, resistance is resistance whatever form \nit comes in, we can create hypertrophy and growth.   When it comes to the abs, it's actually something \nthat you want because the more they grow,   the more they pop, particularly at lower body \nfat levels. This exercise is a keeper. \n  And speaking of suspending your body \nin space, the dip is another exercise   where we get an opportunity to do that. And \nagain, it's one that needs to be included   regardless of whether you have access to a \ngym or you don't. The dip is a great chest,   shoulder and tricep builder, and it actually \nbecomes a lot more difficult more quickly   rather than pushup. Because you're suspending \nyour entire weight of your body in space,   rather than having your feet to offload some of \nyour own body weight like we do in the pushup.   The fact is, we can do this anywhere, guys whether \nyou have access to a dip station or even as I've   mentioned many times before, a kitchen counter \ncorner, wherever we have to do to get it done.   Just make sure you do because this is one of the \nmost effective when it comes to building muscle   and our bodyweight exercise arsenal.\nBack up to the bar here for exercise number   eight and we're talking pullups. \nHey, can I work in with you?\n  Bad timing. \nYou want me to wait?\n  I think so. \nOkay. \n  As I was saying, exercise number eight, the \npullup and we know the versatility of this   exercise extends beyond just this ability to \nbuild a lats. We know that it can be an overall   back builder hitting the entire back, \neven stabilizing through those important   lower lumbar paraspinal muscles, as you can \nsee here. We could even work the arms in   different parts of the arms, making it the perfect \ncomplement to both the chin-up and the human pull   over exercises that already included. The fact is \nyou can't escape the pullup here, whether you're   training in the gym with weight or whether you \nhave access to no weights at all. It's the king   of the upper body bodyweight exercises. \nSpeaking of those upper back muscles,   you know we're not going to get through an entire \nlist without some variation of a face pull in a   Jeff Cavaliere video. But guess what? We have a \nbodyweight version of a face pull that we could   do right here in a doorway. This is the doorway \nface pull and we get the same benefits we do   from a regular face pull. And we can easily \noverload the muscles here that we're targeting   because they tend to be very small muscles that \nrespond fairly quickly to overload because we   don't oftentimes subject them to that. \nWe're talking about the rotator cuff,   the rear delts and also the round \nboys and mid scalp muscles. Again,   it doesn't take a lot here, and oftentimes \nangling your body differently in the doorway   is going to alter the amount of overload you're \ncreating, but it does so in a safe, controlled way   that keeps those gains coming everywhere, \nallowing no muscles to remain untouched. \n  And that brings us to exercise number 10 \nproving once again, thou shalt not skip leg day.   We have the levitation squat, and \nwhat I like here is again the overload   possible from a single leg exercise. But without \nsome of the negatives that might come along with   the pistol squat. In the levitation squad \nwere able to keep a much more neutral pelvis   rather than the extreme posterior tilt we get from \nthe pistol. We have much less knee flexion here,   which allows for people that have some of \nthe issues or meniscal issues to perform   the exercise pain free. And also, is actually a \nmuch easier exercise for beginners to start with,   but still not compromise the gains they can see \nfrom a single leg exercise. The fact is, guys,   it's the perfect exercise to complement that all \nimportant glute ham raise we already covered, and   it's the perfect way to end this list of the best \ncalisthenics exercises for building muscle. \n  And there you have it, guys, the best bodyweight \nexercises when building muscle is your goal.   Remember, there's a lot of things you can do \nthat are far greater difficulty and actually   guys that can do them with far less difficulty. \nThe fact is, when it comes to building muscle,   these are making my list, and these are \nthe ones I want you to focus on. \n  And speaking of guys, I have an entire body weight \ntraining program that requires nothing at all but   your own body weight. It's called Athlean-Xero, \navailable over at Athleanx.com. If you found the   video helpful, leave your comments the thumbs \nup below.
