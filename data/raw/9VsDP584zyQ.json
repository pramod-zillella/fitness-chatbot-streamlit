    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. So what are you doing for the next 22 days? I hope what I show you here today. I put together a 22 day ab workout. Guess what? We've simplified everything because I'm going\nto remove some of the excuses. We're not going to use any equipment, and\nwe're not going to have to worry about all these different exercise variations. What we're going to do is give you a workout\nthat adapts to your ability level and I'm going to pick 22 days as my day, and my target\nbecause we know that it takes about 22 days to develop a habit. If you can stick with this workout – it's\nnot going to take you long – if you can stick with this workout for 22 days in a row,\nwho knows? You might be on your way to a whole new dedication\nto your body in fitness because you're able to stick to this. Here's what we're also going to do: we're\ngoing to make it adaptable to your current ability level. We do that with extinction style training. So with extinction you're going to get a set\ntarget rep, or a set time that you're going to focus on and try to last for each exercise. Six exercises here, following our normal progression\nfor ab training. If you can make it that time you earn yourself\nanother round. 10 seconds and another round of exercise. Advanced people can be at this, and can do\nthis, and can finally get a challenge, no matter how advanced they think they are. If you're more intermediate you're going to\nmaybe die off somewhere in between. If you're in the beginning stages of your\nab training you can still try this. If you need an ab workout as an alternative\nI'll link one in the bottom in the description below for that, but if you want to try this,\ngo for it! If you reach extinction in every single exercise\nyour first time through, so what? You're still getting good ab training in. So guys, I'm going to lay out all the exercises\nfor you, I'm going to describe what each one is working. Remember, we're going to have a different\nextinction goal for each one. Let's get started. Okay, first exercise: heels to the havens. We have a lower ab exercise. Why? Because we're taking the bottom half and we're\nmoving it up on a fixed top half. So with the heels to the heavens, you see\nme doing here, if you're a beginner and you want to try this you have two things you can\ndo. You want to aim for pushing up, straight up\nthrough the ceiling, get your hips off the ground. Just don’t lower as much as somebody that's\na little bit more advanced. Do this for 45 seconds. This is your extinction level. Again, if you don’t make it all the way\nthrough that's fine. You're going to move to the next exercise\nright away. If you do make it for the 45 seconds you get\na 10 second rest and you have to repeat this exercise again. You keep doing that, resting 10 seconds after\neach completed round until you cannot make the 45 seconds, an then you move onto the\nnext level. You see, this is how we accommodate people\nwith all levels of ability. Nobody is getting away with an easy workout\nhere. Moving on, now we're going to go bottom up\nrotation. Again, lower half moving, and rotating this\ntime, on a fixed top half. We do that with our step through plank. So look, here we're going to take our body,\nwe're basically keeping the top of our body fixed here by keeping our forearms in contact\nwith the ground, and the shoulders facing the ground. But we're going to rotate the hips as I step\nthrough, alternating from one side to the next. The idea here is, you're going for a 45 second\nextinction time. If you can last the whole 45 seconds you're\ndoing it again until you cannot. Next we move onto our mid-range movement. Here we want to hit both the top and the bottom,\nmoving together. We can do that with what we call our X-Men\ncrunch. For the first time, the extinction is not\na time goal, it's a rep goal. But you understand what that means by now. The rep goal here is 12. You're going to do this exercise here. It's not easy, but you're not coming all the\nway to a complete V-sit position here. You just want to bring your legs and your\nhands all together toward the top, and then come back down into this \"X\" position. Legs spread out and continue to repeat. 12 reps here is your extinction goal. Moving on we've got to hit the obliques, too\nbecause they obviously count. I tell you all the time. They taper in that midsection. So what we do is an alternating thread the\nneedle. The alternating thread the needle is going\nto take the thread the needle exercise that I've demonstrated here before, and you're\ngoing to go opposite, alternating left and right. So you take it here, you reach up to the sky,\nfrom here you've got to thread the needle, and reach all the way under. Don’t lose your balance. Then we come back out of it, come down, settle,\nand then repeat to the opposite side. Go all the way up, come down, reach through,\ncome back out of it, settle in the middle, and go back. Extinction here is reps, once again. It's 10 to each side. See if you can make it all the way through. If you can; great job. You just earned yourself 10 more to each side. If you didn’t we're moving onto the next\nexercise anyway. Okay, we've got two left here. The top down movement comes first. What are we talking about? If the bottom up was a fixed top and a moveable\nbottom, now it's trying to keep the bottom as stationary as possible and removing the\ntop down on top of that. Now the jackknife is going to allow us to\ndo this. There's a little bit of movement on the legs,\nbut it's not the primary focus. So we get here in this position, you have\nyour hands out, and arms out straight, and you're basically going to come up, do a crunch\nfrom the top, let the leg move up just a little bit higher than the other one, settle back\ndown, and go to the other side. You keep going back and forth here. This is back to time again. We're trying to go for 45 seconds on this\nalternating jackknife. Let's go for it. Make as many as you can. When you reach extinction you've got one exercise\nleft. All right, finally we've got to go top down\nagain, but this time with rotation. We do it with what we call a stationary bike. People do bicycles all the time, and they\nbasically go so fast that they're actually not even contracting or working their muscles\nwith any real focus, or attention. But with the stationary bike we're forced\nto. So I get down on the ground here, knees come\nup to 90 degrees, hands go behind my head, clasping, or pulling on my neck, and what\nI'm trying to do is literally keep a little bit of contraction here to that top – already\ncontracted – pulled off the floor, shoulder blades off the floor, and I'm trying to rotate\nside to side. One elbow toward the opposite knee, the other\nelbow toward the opposite knee. Don’t move the lower half. Keep that stationary, hence the name. But basically, we want to make sure that we're\nrotating from the top down. This is 30 seconds. This is not that easy. It's a lot harder than whipping away at reps\non one of those classic bicycles. You're going to get a lot more out of this. 30 second extinction. When you make it all the way through this\n– and really, when you fail to make it all the way through this – your workout has\nended. All right, so there you have it. Again, simple. We're going to eliminate all the excuses. The equipment, the exercise variation, but\nnot easy. I don’t think it's supposed to be easy. Nothing worth having should be easy. Give this one a try, no matter what ability\nlevel you are. If you can work your way up over the course\nof the 22 days then take advantage of that and go for it. guys, if you're looking for a program that\nputs the science back in strength, trains you the way you should, allows muscles to\nwork the way that they want to work; head to ATHLEANX.com and get our ATHLEANX training\nprogram.
