    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Five minutes. If that makes you feel really good because\nyou're thinking \"Oh my God. Finally, and easy workout.\" Not so fast. You should know by now that when you come\nhere five minutes doesn't mean coasting through your workout. It actually means exactly the opposite. Five minutes means ramping up the intensity\nlevel on your workout to levels you haven't even tried before. I say 'tried', because a lot of times it will\nhold you back from getting to your goal, it's the fact that you're just not putting in the\neffort that you're capable of. So I'm going to show you today how we're going\nto do that. We're going to take it to the frantic level. Now, that doesn’t mean sloppy, shitty performance\non your workout. No. It actually means you're going to carry out\nthe exercises as they're supposed to be done, but at a much higher effort level. So when we look at the workout here, we want\nto make sure that whatever it is for you – maybe it's not exactly the level that I'm demonstrating,\nbut what it is, is something different that you are used to giving. This will make five minutes feel like 55 minutes\nreally, really fast. So here's what we're going to do: you get\non the floor and you go to the first exercise. It's mountain climbers. Now, mountain climbers is one of those exercises\nthat we tend to do, sort of like this. You know, as if we're going to do it for 60\nminutes. That's not what we're looking for here today\nbecause we've only got five minutes to prove our point. What we're going to do is take it to that\nfrantic level, and I'm going to do them like this. Obviously, the effort level is much, much\nhigher, and because I'm only doing it for 30 seconds I've got to give it everything\nI've got. As I said, if your effort doesn't look exactly\nlike this, at least make sure it looks more than what you're used to giving. After that we immediately go into 20 seconds\nof a side kick through. A side kick through is another exercise that\ncould be done like this because that is a side kick through, but I could also do a side\nkick through like this. That will be much more frantic. In other words, much more high-effort, much\nmore intense, more appropriate for when we're cutting down the time for when we're working\nout. Then we go into 10 seconds of our final exercise\nhere, which is squat burpee. So burpees: people do them all the time. They kind of do them at this pace because\nthey're planning out that they're doing it for a long period of time, so \"I have to pace\nmyself.\" We ain't pacing ourselves here, guys. We're into actually exerting as much effort\nas you humanly can give out in five minutes. So we're going to do ours in a shorter range\nof motion, in a much more explosive way. Again, if you can't do it with this type of\npop up and down, at least do it as quickly as you can. Now, you get a 10 seconds rest period. I know it's short, but we don’t have much\ntime to play around with here. We're going to back through this circuit again. What you did for 30 seconds is now done for\n10. What you did for 20 seconds is now done for\n30. And what you did for 10 seconds is now done\nfor 20, okay? You're going to wrap around, same exercises. The second time through you're going to get\n20 seconds rest. Then we're going to come through one more\ntime and whatever you didn't do for 30 seconds yet, you're going to do that for 30 seconds. Whatever you didn't do for 20, you're doing\nfor 20. And whatever you haven't done for 10, you're\ndoing it for 10. But the same three exercises, with as high\nof an effort level as you possibly can, and this time you're getting a 30 seconds rest. Which leaves us one more minute. In that last minute you'll do 20 seconds of\neach exercise without rest. That is five minutes. Now I'm going to show you how it looks. As you can see, I'm already a little bit out\nof breath because I've already done this, but I'm going to get back down here again\nand do it with you. All right, guys. Let's take a look at it in action. So there you have it, guys! Five minutes later. Hopefully you've proven to yourself one very,\nvery major point. That is: effort is going to trump everything\nwhen it comes to the results that you see from your training. I don’t care how long you want to train\nfor. Especially if you plan on training for a short\nperiod of time, your effort level better be even more through the roof than ever before\nif you want to see results from that. I think it's a great way to train because\nas natural athletes – as people that train without the assistance of drugs – you're\ngoing to need to be able to find ways to train hard, but then get out of the gym, and optimize\nyour recovery. This is one way that we can do it, but as\nI said, it ain't easy, and you'd better be prepared to work. That being said guys, I work you and I'm glad\nto work you. Our ATHLEANX training program is designed\nto work you hard, but not work you for very, very long. That five minutes – if you're looking for\nonly five minute workouts, you're probably not at that stage where you're really committed\nto what we're doing here. However, if you're looking for a little example\nto convince yourself that it can be done, that there's much more level of effort left\nin you that maybe you're holding onto; then this is perfect for what we're trying to do. In the meantime, guys, our programs are over\nat ATHLEANX.com. The Max Shred program that I've been doing\nlately, which has gotten me in better condition, but at the same time it's got that side effect\nof allowing me to drop some more fat than I already had; it works, guys. That's over at ATHLEANX.com as well. In the meantime, if you've found this video\nhelpful leave your comments below. Let me know what you want to see and I will\ndo my best to bring those videos to you here in the days and weeks ahead. All right, I'll see you soon."
