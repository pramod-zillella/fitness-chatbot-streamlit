    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today we’re talking about the traps and\nhow to make sure you’re not messing up your trap training when you’re doing it. Before we start, I want to ask you a quick\nword association question. If I name a muscle, what pops into your mind,\nvisually? If I said ‘biceps’, what pops into your\nmind? Probably this, right? What if I said ‘chest’? This is the chest. I think we’re probably two for two. If I said ‘shoulders’, I think we’re\nprobably now three for three. If I said ‘traps’ what would you think? Would you think this? Because if you do, that’s part of the problem\nwe have right here. This is not the traps. This is part of the traps. These are the upper traps. In order to have a fully developed back, more\nimportantly, a fully functional back, you need to make sure you’re training the rest\nof this. As a matter of fact, the larger portion of\nthis – the middle trap and the lower trap – the traps are a kite muscle, shaped like\nthis. When you train them, all portions of them,\nyour shoulders can work more efficiently and effectively. I want to make sure you do that at all times. The upper traps are what get most of the attention\nbecause it’s what stands up here, making us look like we’re bigger. We have a bigger neck, the whole deal. But I don’t really program a lot of direct\nupper trap work into our programs. I don’t have a lot of direct, upper trap\nwork here on our channel because we can target this area of the traps pretty efficiently\nwith some of our compound movements. The things that form the foundation of what\nwe do. A heavy deadlift is certainly going to overload\nthe traps. Especially if you go a little wider on your\ngrip. We know a row can certainly overload the traps,\nas you can see here. We know that carries are an effective way\nto load the traps. It’s a little more for endurance, but it’s\nanother way to load the traps. We build those into the foundation of everything\nwe do. You don’t necessarily need to have a lot\nof upper trap work. As a matter of fact, what happens is, when\nyou start to overdo your trap work you start to create muscle imbalance. You start to create a dominant forward shoulder. You start to create posture problems. You start to create related weakness throughout\nyour shoulder because of this dominance here. What we want to do – upper cross syndrome. We don’t want to go down that path. We want to make sure we’re focusing on the\nother stuff. So, what we want to do is start incorporating\nother exercises. Guys, I’m going to make this very, very\neasy for you. You’re not going to have to do 10 more exercises. The first thing you want to do is hit the\nmiddle traps. This is the best way I know how to do it. This is a wraparound row. All you’re going to do is grab the left\nhandle with the right hand, and the right handle with the left hand. You don’t even have cables or handles here. You can do this with bands. But you’re going to want to keep your elbows\nin tight to your body. You wraparound and keep your elbow around\nand tight, trying to retract the scapula. We can do it in a lot of different cadences\nand sequences, as you see here. I can do one arm at a time, I could hold one\nin contraction while I bring the other one around. I can do both at the same time. That’s more of a preference in how you do\nit and how we can feel it more effectively. But the concept is keeping the moment arm\nshort by not going out this way and bringing our arms out into a T, which is a middle trap\nexercise, we’re removing a lot of the rear delt from that movement because we shorten\nthat. We take that rear delt out a lot more. We don’t make it that much more difficult\nto achieve and get to the area we’re trying to work on. So, if we keep it short and wrapped in tight,\nwe’re going to get more of that scapular retraction driven by the middle trap. This is what I want you to do: include some\nof those exercises when you train your traps. If you’re going to do a classic shrug like\nthis, make sure you’re doing a little bit of middle trap work with it. One for one. Give me one set for every set you do of your\nshrugs. Now, the lower traps are incredibly important\nfor the motion and proper motion of the shoulder as you raise it up over your head. We want to work the lower trap with this exercise. This is a prone press. You’re going to find it’s very humbling. You don’t need to have a lot of weight to\ndo this exercise. As a matter of fact, some people will find\nthat just doing the motion alone is all they need to overload this portion because it’s\na chronically weak portion of the traps. As I mentioned, we don’t even visualize\nit, let alone train it. We want to make sure we do that and do some\nlower trap work. Now, here’s the best part about this. If you’ve been watching my channel for any\nlength of time, if you knew how much I value the face pull, you’d be doing face pulls\nafter every, single workout. You’re listening to me, you’re doing your\nface pulls every time you train. If you do the face pull, there’s a slight\nmodification you can make to make this exercise hit the middle trap and lower trap even more\neffectively. You do this: you do a face pull with this\nelevated raise at the end. All you have to do is take that pull back,\nsame mechanics, proper mechanics of a face pull. You lead with the hands. Don’t lead with the elbows because if you\nlead with the elbows you’re going to go into internal rotation of the shoulder. You want to create external rotation and get\nthe shoulder working with the rotator cuff and the mid-scap muscles, all of them working\ntogether the way they prefer to. So, we lead with the hands back and then from\nhere, we keep it there, raise our arms up over our head. Now, the force is pulling our arms this way. Whether you’re using bands, whether you’re\nusing cables, it’s pulling my hands out in front of my body. I have to work hard to keep myself retracted. But now I’m combining that retraction with\nthe elevation and going through the whole range of motion. We’re going to hit the middle traps, we’re\ngoing to hit those lower traps, and of course, the face pull itself is good for hitting the\nupper traps as well. So, if you want to go for that faster route,\ndo the face pulls, as always, add this slight tweak to it, and you’re going to really\nget done everything I need you to get done. Guys, hopefully you have a better appreciation\nof the traps. The next time someone says “Hey, what are\nthe traps?” You’ll draw that whole picture, mentally,\nin your mind of that entire kite. Upper, middle, and lower, and make sure you\nget it right every time in your training. If you’re looking for programs that don’t\noverlook any muscle – because they all matter – we do that for you step by step in our\nprograms over at ATHLEANX.com.
