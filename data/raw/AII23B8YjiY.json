    "description": "If you want bigger calves then you have to watch this. The calf muscles are one of the most stubborn muscle groups of the legs to ...",
    "transcript": "if you're going to do calf raises don't do them like this because your calves likely won't grow look we already have a hard enough time getting them to grow as it is but if you keep bouncing through every repetition it ain't going to happen and there's a reason for it anatomically our Achilles tendon that the calf muscles attached to are built for these ballistic bouncy type repetitions if you want to actually get the muscle itself to feel what you're doing then slow it down and when you get to the bottom hold it for 4 seconds to take all that ballistic stretch aspect of it out of the Achilles and force it to be felt by the muscle itself when you get back up to the top feel that contraction for 4 seconds up there too again these bouncy repetitions up and down aren't helping you out at all focus on every contraction at the top and every elongation at the bottom you'll get much better CS because of it"
