    "transcript": "What's up guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM. So today we're going to bring you a Barbell\nAb Workout. So it's Washboard Wednesday. A lot of guys don't really realize that they\ncan do a lot for their Core with a Barbell and the great thing about it is it gives us an opportunity to do weighted\nAb work. We've talked about it before, in fact even\ndevoted an entire video to the benefits of weighted Ab training. If you haven't seen that already guys, I'll\nlink for you right here. But in the meantime, it's time for something\nnew. So I'm going to give you guys a 4 exercise\nworkout that you can do with a Barbell setup as an Olympic Land Mine setup. Just stick one Barbell, load it up on one\nend, stick it in the corner. Let's get this thing rolling. So there you go guys. 4 exercises, one Ab workout, a lot of stabilization\nin there. Working the Obliques for sure. Definitely working the Abs in a functional\nway and really again, adding the benefit of weights to the workout\nso that we get some progressive overload. Key for any muscle, key here for the Abs here\nas well. Guys if you're looking for a complete Training\nProgram that gives you progressive overload and literally steps it out for you and lays out the blueprint, day by day by\nday, including all your Ab training as well, make sure you head to ATHLEANX.COM and get\nour ATHLEANX Training System. In the meantime, if you've found this one\nhelpful and you want to see more workouts here on Washboard Wednesday just let me know below and I will do my best\nto bring them to you. Alright guys, I'll see you soon."
