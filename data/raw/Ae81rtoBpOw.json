    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com so today i have a challenge and the challenge is actually thrown at me and I'm gonna actually answer that challenge for you you see somebody said Jeff put up your ten fingers now each of these ten fingers has to represent one thing your ten best home exercises you only get ten because you only got ten fingers what would they be and I know that we're going through a time right now where we need these options so what I want to do is I want to pare them down I'm gonna cover your entire body in just ten selections all right so be ready to hear guys I'm gonna hit every muscle in your body let's start with the first choice right here I'm so exercise number one I actually care so much about this that I climbed all the way up here to cozy up with it to announce it it's the pull-up guys you know how much I love this exercise when it comes to training your back there's no better exercise than this you can see here that it is obviously one of the most demanding bodyweight exercises and it is a home exercise because all you need to do if you don't have a big elaborate setup like this it's going vest in a simple pull-up bar for about 15 bucks the fact is it can't escape the benefits that this exercise provides is absolutely the number one for your back now hold on a second I know some of you out there are saying but Jeff what if I can't do pull-ups I'm not gonna be able to take advantage of this video no not true I'm gonna give you guys a step-down variation so that you have an option no matter what level you're at right now for everyone the ten best I'm gonna show you here and when it comes to the pull-up if you can't do them guys you can do this this is your inverted row and the inverted row while working your back in a different plane more horizontal instead of vertical it's still gonna provide a great exercise option for you when you're stuck training at home and maybe you don't have that pull-up bar or you just can't do them right now alright so exercise number two now is actually another back exercise because you see I don't think we ever train our back enough and this one here something you can do anywhere literally anywhere you could hook your hands under something it could be on a closed door it could be under a coffee table or can even be grabbing the leg of your bed this is called a human pullover and what we're doing here is we're not necessarily trying to work our ABS although they will obviously be working to stabilize your body what you're doing is you're pulling your body up by pulling your hands into this fixed base here basically doing a lap pull over but except instead of moving the dumbbell you're moving your body this exercise is challenging you could obviously shorten your legs social unweight some of the load that you're lifting but the better thing is to just continue to try to get stronger at this and if you can't do this at all right now you do have a home option and that is the sliding pulldown I've showed this to you before it's one of my favorite exercises you can do at home you're literally once again allowing your arms to drive you into a straight arm push down by allowing your body to slide in and out on the floor providing the resistance either way guys this pairs up perfectly with the pull-ups for that great one-two punch that you need in the first two spots on my selection of the ten best exercise number three now is gonna be for your chest and it's a push up now look you know I have some issues at the push up but you have to do it right in other words that means getting fully extended and also doing something else here and that is trying to get some relative adduction involved because we know that to fully contract the chest you want to try to somehow bring your arm across your body and we know the challenge that the push-up provides because your hands are in a fixed spot you really can't get that unless you do this and this is the rotational or twisting pushup and you can see that every time I come up I literally twist my body into my arm which creates that relative adduction which gets a better contraction in the chest which ultimately makes this a better version of any push-up that you're going to do now the beauty about this is it has its own step down or step up variations if I want to make this more difficult I can simply put my feet up on to something like a couch and do a decline version or I go the opposite way and I put my hands up on something higher than me which is an incline push-up and it makes it easier but you can see that no matter which version I choose I'm still able to add that rotation and therefore make the exercise more effective exercise choice number four this time we're moving up the arm a little bit here to the biceps and if I have one thing to do for the biceps I'm going right back up to the pull-up bar here to do this and this is a bicep chin curl so I've talked about this one before it's all in how you do the exercise this is not just the chin up although that is a good exercise for your biceps as well this will add that additional load that helps to overload the biceps more effectively I'm actually allowing myself to kind of lean back and I'm pulling up until that bar crosses my forehead on every single repetition essentially trying to curl a bar straight up to my forehead except I don't have a bar I've got my body being pulled up to that bar this is a really effective way to train your biceps but I get it once again it's a little bit difficult and if you don't have that pull-up bar then what do you do we do this instead this is just an inverted chin curl the same thing applies here though I'm not just doing an inverted row I'm actually shifting my body forward so that when I curl I'm really just curling mostly from that elbow joint targeting the biceps more effectively the fact is guys no matter which one you go with their both gonna hit you hard and they both deserve a spot on a fourth finger of mine I just want to make sure you're still paying attention so exercise number five it's one that you could actually do sitting down or actually using the damn chairs that you're sitting on you see because this one's gonna work your triceps and if the upright tricep dip you see if you take these two chairs and you position them this way now you've got the perfect station here to do your dips and I like doing them across two chairs here because it's gonna like force you to remain upright and the action of staying more upright actually keeps your elbows tighter to your side so that you get a better contraction on the long head of the triceps right we know that the more we lean forward the more our arms are out in front which is good for elbow extension but if we really want to get that long head of the triceps fully contracted it's got to get to our side or back behind our body so let's say you can't do this exercise though what do you do what your still can sit down but you do this instead it's to see the tricep dip it requires a perfect setup you don't want your hands facing forward you want your hands rotate it back to open up your shoulders and put your shoulders in a healthier position to do the exercise and then from here you go down no lower than 90 degrees you come up once again you see that good heart contraction on the triceps if you're trying to hit your triceps guys either one of these is going to do the job it remains here on that fifth finger for a reason I've showed you move on to our second hand here we actually used this thing right here hanging on my thumb and that is a band you see it's an affordable piece of equipment that's going to open up a whole bunch of possibilities when it comes to great home exercise options and when we're training the legs guys added resistance is crucial when you're training in the home environment so my choice here though I'd have to pick between say a pistol squat I'm gonna lean a little bit more towards this one instead and this is a banded Bulgarian split squat you guys know how much I like the exercise but beyond that we can actually create some pretty good resistance by simply doubling up the band what normally provides about 40 or 50 pounds of resistance in this band we actually now get around 80 to 100 pounds and this is pretty tough that's like holding a pair of 40 or 50 pound dumbbells now that may not be the appropriate load for everybody but at least it's a good starting point and it gives you an option that's much better let's say a whole bunch of air squats and if you don't have a band but you still want to benefit from this exercise you do have the option to do this instead and that is simply just to slow down the bodyweight version of the exercise that means to create more tension within the exercise you're performing and this one and a half rep version of the Bulgarian split squat is definitely going to be more challenging and it's going to be an equalizer for those that used to crank out just a whole bunch of repetitions of this unchallenged exercise number seven now turns it around and hits the other side of the legs the posterior chain and my favorite here is right here on a slick floor we call it the slick floor bridge curl this one is one of my favorite posterior chain exercises regardless of whether or not you're training in a gym or not because what it does is it integrates those hamstrings and glutes together and I don't care how much you RDL this one's going to bring you to your knees or maybe in this case to the floor and if you can't do it guys all I suggest is that you simply don't let your legs go out as far start by letting they'll go out just a little bit and then as you get stronger and stronger you're gonna be able to get them all the way out exercise number eight now we're sticking with the posterior chain and all you need to do is get one of these bad boys here the glute-ham raise guys and you're good to go okay you know I wouldn't do that to you see you can actually replicate the benefits of this without actually needing this machine and all you have to do is set yourself up like this so you're going to set something up in front of you to actually catch your weight and the idea is to e centrically let yourself lower to overload those glutes and hamstrings and then when you get down to that surface you allow yourself to push off just to the point where you can actually then catch concentric Li the exercise and pull yourself back up to the top using those glutes and hamstrings once again now if you're a little bit more on the advanced side that all I would do is try to take the box away and then use a push-up to get yourself out of the bottom position either way you're still trying to grab hold and can centrally pull yourself up it's not to push up driving you up it's just to push up driving you to the point where you can get those hamstrings and glutes working to pull you up moving on to exercise number nine we got to hit those shoulders guys and there's no better option I don't care where you're at then right here against the wall and it's with the handstand push-up this is a simulation of the overhead press now there is some limitation in terms of how low you can get your body would do the exercise but you can even fix that by placing your hands up on top of a couple books so you get a little bit more range of motion the fact is this is a very challenging way to work your shoulders that does its best to simulate that overhead press but let's say you can't do it because I'm saying this is a very difficult exercise what are you gonna do try this this is the dive-bomber and all we're doing is simply modifying the angle of our body so that we're not totally vertical but more at this 45-degree angle but the idea is still the same you're pressing your body out of that bottom position and a little bit less of a decline here but still overloading the shoulders primarily on every single repetition and you didn't think that this last little finger of mine wasn't gonna be reserved for a face pull did you see the thing is this you got to do it because it's always going to fit into my top ten best if you're gonna give me ten matter facts probably my five but I don't care how you do it you see cuz when you're home you have a lot of options what I'd like to see you do is maybe try this one out and this just uses a door and I showed you a whole video about why this is a superior version of the face pool and why it helps to engage all the muscles of your upper back including that hard to hit rotator cuff but we can just take the more standard version if you still have that banned from the Bulgarian split squat you just do the bandit version of this or you can just do what I showed you in previous video and that's just to throw a plate inside of a towel and do these instead guys I don't care how you do them the fact is just do them they're always gonna belong and the 10 best of any list of mine and so with no fingers left here guys I didn't actually forget about your core what I did do is I put together an entire video six-pack abs in 22 days I want you guys to check it out it's a great ab routine you're gonna want to make sure you do it is perfect for the home environment
