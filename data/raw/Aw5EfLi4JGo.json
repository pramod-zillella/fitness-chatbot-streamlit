    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today I want to talk to you about the deadlift.\nAnd what's sparking this discussion here today is a recent appearance by Strong Man, Robert\nOberst, on Joe Rogan's podcast. Now, I didn't need the viewers to alert me to this, as they\nhave, because I listen to the podcast. I’m a fan of Joe's podcast. C.T. Fletcher has been on there, Sylvester\nStallone is going to be on there; I listen to it often. There's a lot of content in this\npodcast, but one thing in particular that has people bent and they want to know what\nI think about it is this statement. I don’t want to take anything out of context. I want to just play it for you so you can\nlisten to it for yourself. ROBERT: I went from football to Strong Man,\nand in football we've never done deadlifts. It was all hang-cleans and power-cleans. Which,\nby the way, just a quick tip: deadlifts, if you're deadlifting to be a better dead-lifter,\nfine. If you're not doing that for deadlift's sake, then don’t f**king do it. The risk to reward ratio is a joke. JOE: For deadlifts? ROBERT: For deadlifts. JOE: Really? ROBERT: I mean, a lot of people aren't going\nto like that I'm saying that, but if you go into any NFL gym, or any division I college\nfootball gym, and any athletics where people are actually getting paid, and it matters\nwhat they're doing; they're not deadlifting. JOE: Really? ROBERT: They're hang-cleaning and power-cleaning. JOE: Why is that? ROBERT: It's the risk to reward ratio. It's\nso hard to be a great dead-lifter and not risk your low back and- JOE: Oh. ROBERT: And to be using your upper back properly.\nThere are so many little chances for you to get hurt. JEFF: All right, guys. Before you go and try\nto jump down Robert's throat or assume what I'm going to say in response to that, I think\nwe have to do a couple of things. Number one: we're going to have to apply some context\nto what he said, and we'll do that in a second. Number two: we're going to have to start with\nthe admission that, guys, I'm obviously someone who's already buried a few exercises myself.\nI threw, willfully, a couple of exercises into my Iron Graveyard to never be performed\nagain. One of them being the upright row, which was a sh*t exercise then, will be a\nsh*t exercise in the future, and is a sh*t exercise now. I'll say that because, as we know, you are\nliterally fighting your own body's anatomy to perform it and we have alternatives that\nprovide a better response, nullifying the reason that we would ever have to do it in\nthe first place. We could say the same thing about the behind-the-neck shoulder press. Neither of those are necessary and I think\nthey deserve to be dead and buried. However, when it comes to the deadlift that's not something\nI would ever say. I believe the deadlift is one of the most fundamental movement patterns,\nlet alone training exercises. The deadlift is something that we all need\nto be able to incorporate into our training programs and figure out a way to strengthen\nourselves, but [do it] the right way. Which leads us to some of the context of what Robert's\ntalking about. I'll start with the professional athlete side of it because I think what he's\nsaying there, there's a lot of truth and merit to that. As a matter of fact, I've been in a lot of\nprofessional sports weight rooms. I've been in around a lot of professional athletes and\ntrained a lot of professional athletes. And I'll tell you this: one of the revelations\nyou learn early on is that they're not the best lifters. A lot of times they don’t\neven have great form in the weight room. They didn’t get there by being great lifters.\nThey got here because of their innate talents. They got there because of their athleticism.\nThey got there because of their ability to compensate their way there. They're masters\nof compensation. They were able to overcome things that we may not be able to while being\nable to still excel and perform. A lot of times what you're left with is guys\nthat come to the weight room that are limited in a lot of different ways. Sometimes, not\nforcing everybody to perform a lift because you know how valuable that lift is, is one\nof the best ways a strength coach can go. I know the Oakland Raiders, my buddy is a\nstrength coach for the Oakland Raiders, and not everybody deadlifts straight from the\nfloor. There are guys that are 6' 8\", 320lbs to guys that are defensive backs, and skilled\nposition players that lift a bit differently, and approach it a bit differently, and their\nbodies align differently when they go there. Again, if you realize that, unfortunately,\nthe truth of the matter is that they're not all getting there as great lifters. Like I\nsaid. Their high school years, their formative years, the first time they ever learned the\ndeadlift could have been founded on a foundation that was severely cracked because no one ever\ninstilled in them the right way to do it. And they brought that with them to college.\nAnd they brought that with them to the pros. While you try to intervene, it's not always\nsomething you're capable of intervening on because, as I've said before, even their ability\nto master the compensation here could hide some of those cracked flaws in their foundation. So, what they do with the Raiders is, they\nlift with mats off the floor. They put ½\" mats and they might elevate a few mats – two,\nthree, four mats – to allow the weights to come a little bit off the floor to get\nthem into a better body position. Not foregoing the deadlift altogether, but\neven as Robert said, the exercises he said, yes, they'll perform those as well because\nthey could provide some additional benefits that might not subject somebody to the risk.\nHe talked about the risk to reward ratio. That's a real issue, guys. When you're talking\nabout people that are being paid to play. Being paid to play and who can excel at the\nhighest levels without necessarily having an 800lb deadlift. What is the risk of pushing\nsomebody in that direction? Is it going to get them stronger? Of course. But if there\nare other ways to get them stronger and more powerful, maybe you don’t go down that road\nbecause you don’t want to compromise somebody's career that way. So that's the first thing. The second thing is, we talked about the context.\nThe context is, as the speaker, as a professional Strong Man, Robert is looking at this from\na different perspective. He's looking out for us. He's looking out for you. He knows\nthat, for him, the risk to reward ratio is different. For him, the reward was higher.\nHe could win a competition. He could sacrifice his form a little bit if\nit meant getting up another 10lbs or 20lbs on a lift because for him, it could mean the\ndifference between winning and losing. When you add some competitiveness to this, and\noverly the performance of that lift there's a different drive. There's a different motivator.\nBut for him, it led to some other issues. Obviously, breakdown. It's something he's doing repetitively and\nhe's doing it for a living. At least the breakdown. These are not the same things that we would\nhave to consider. But it brings me back to this overall point: the deadlift is a great\nexercise. The deadlift is a fundamental movement pattern. But the deadlift should be done responsibly. It's one of those exercises that, because\nof the loading parameters here, because we can load it up a lot as we're pursuing strength\non that lift, we have to understand this one, critical factor. That is that it's not the\nnumber of the plates on the side of the bar that will ultimately determine your strength. What matters the most is that the true strength\nunderlying that is built on a foundation of stability. I've said this before. I've talked\nabout it as the new way to look at the pyramid of strength. At the base of what we do, most\nof what we do, is always going to be founded on strength. But if you ignore that bottom there, underneath\nthe surface, that 'iceberg' effect where stability resides then you're going to miss out and\nyou're likely going to wind up hurting yourself. The true strength is always going to be built\nupon a foundation of stability. What are we talking about with stability? It's not what\nyou might think I'm talking about. Some of you guys are probably saying \"Jeff,\nyou're just talking about form. Good form versus bad form.\" We never advocate bad form\non a deadlift. That's not what I'm talking about. In the gross evidence of that, yes,\nit is. In other words, if I was going to go grab\nthe bar, and as soon as I lift the weight that's somewhat more than I can comfortably\nhandle, if I lose my scapular tightness to the point where my arms start to protract\nout in front of me, dragging my thoracic spine into flexion – which, because the spine\nis one unit it starts to drag my lumbar spine into flexion – applying an incredible load\non my lumbar discs; I could pop on just like that. That's an obvious form breakdown. That's a\nlack of stability. That's an obvious example of that. That's not even what I'm talking\nabout. I've talked about the masters of compensation. I've talked about the fact that someone could\nexecute a deadlift here in great form and still lack stability. How would that happen?\nWell you could do all the things I've said. You could keep the scapula tight, you could\nnot have your thoracic rounding, you could not have your lumbar spine rounding, but you\ncould have an unequal distribution of weight between your feet when you perform your lift.\nI had an athlete come to me like that, complaining of hip pain. Everything looked perfect on the deadlift\nitself, but when we evaluated with force plates you could tell that there's an unequal weight\ndistribution between the right and left side. Is that a lack of stability? I think so. That's\nnot a stable unit lifting that. You need to have a stable unit from the ground up, equally\ndistributing the weight as you perform the lift. That's a solid system. But if you're talking\nabout this unequal distribution of weight that doesn't manifest itself in bad form,\nbut manifests itself underneath; this is what we need to start to evaluate at a bit more\ncritical level. This is where we need to appreciate the value of true stability. So, what am I\nrecommending? I recommend you deadlift. I recommend you learn how to deadlift at an\nearly age. I'm hoping that exercise tutorials, like the one I have on our channel for the\ndeadlift – and others as well who have covered the deadlift in great ways, with a great breakdown\n– teaches you how to perform the lift in your earlier years, the right way. So, when you're adding plates, as you should\nbe trying to, you're doing it on a strong foundation. Not built off a cracked foundation.\nWay too many cracked foundations out there these days, following the advice of the coaches\nthat know nothing about coaching a lift, that tell you just to get stronger on the lift. That's a horrible coach and one you should\nnever listen to. What you need to do is learn how to respect that lift, as well as other\nlifts, realizing that sometimes you've got to start at the bottom. When you start at\nthe bottom, you've got to build that base. That base is not just the strength, but it's\nthe stability beneath that. And when you have that combination and then\nyou add plates around that you're going to be able to perform that lift properly. More\nimportantly, you're going to be able to perform that lift for life, without the repercussions\nthat Robert even talked about here. Without the necessary drive to push it to\nextremes that he might have to because of the competitive overlay for it and the extra\ndrive with which he might have to face because of something he did for a living, and the\nwinning and losing that factored into it as well. I love what he said. I thought it was\na great podcast, by the way. Like I said, I recommend if you haven't heard\nit that you go listen to is because he had some incredible things to say. I think his\nperspective on the sport, I think his perspective on, not just that lift, but other things is\nsomething you benefit from hearing. Guys, I hope you've found this video helpful. If you're looking for programs where we try\nto do what we do based off that solid foundation, I realize how important it is. I preach it\nhere because it matters, guys. I've seen far too many athletes breakdown because of exactly\nwhat Robert's talking about. We don’t need to have that happen, and we don’t need to\nforego the deadlift at the same time. Guys, if you're looking for those programs,\nthey're all over at ATHLEANX.com. In the meantime, if you've found the video helpful leave your\ncomments and thumbs up below. Let me know what else you want me to cover and I'll do\nmy best to do that for you.
