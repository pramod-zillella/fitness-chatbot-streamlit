    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today I've got Jesse with me – oh, wait. I've got Jesse with me and we're going to\nshow you what to do about tight hips. A lot of times, guys will say, \"Oh, my hips\nare so tight\", or they'll even say, \"My hip flexors are so tight, and I can't squat\". Guys, it doesn't make sense because at no\npoint – yes, your hip flexors should be activated in the descent of the squat, actively\npulling you down, but it's not a hip tightness. They're not being stretched at the bottom\nof the squat. As a matter of fact, they're getting more\nlax. So, what we want to do is fix somebody like\nJesse who has some tightness on a squat. Go ahead and squat down. He gets up and he feels tightness in through\nhere. What's causing that? I'm going to help you, guys. We're going to go through three stages. Number one: we're going to take a look at\nthe non-Jesse, Raymond over here, to look at skeletal factors and things that you can\ndo right away to fix the tightness that you're having. The next thing we have to do is look inside\nthe joint a little bit. Right around something we call the 'hip capsule'. A lot of times we don’t really address this. This is going to have some mobility actions\nthat we could do to try and get to the root of it. And then if that doesn't work, there are some\nother things we tend to always overlook at the muscle level. It's not just about stretching the muscles. It's about what the activity of those muscles\nare and what the stability of those muscles are because if it's not there, you're going\nto get some compensation in other places that will be causing these tight hips. So, when stretching is not working you've\ngot to look in other places. This video is going to help you finally get\nto the root of it. Obviously, there are a lot of things that\ncould be causing that tightness and that restriction, but we've got to start somewhere to figure\nit out. The easiest place to do that is staying right\nhere on the ground. No, you don’t have me to do this for you,\nbut the good news is, you don’t need me to do this for you. You just take your hip through three different\nranges of motion. The first is: how much flexion do you have? You could do this yourself, again, by grabbing\nonto your knee and pulling up. For Jesse, he's got good flexion. He can get well past waistline and it doesn’t\nfeel hard at the end. You want to make sure it's not feeling like\nit's running into a wall, but it has some bounciness to it. The next thing is, you want to check internal\nrotation. Even though the foot is moving that way, outward,\nthe hip is actually going into internal rotation. You want to look and see how much rotation\nyou can get here. 30 to 45 degrees would be great. Jesse's got good rotation. Again, you don’t need me to do that. Although it's easier. You can do that yourself, just to test that. Then we have to go into external rotation. With external rotation here, we're going this\ndirection. What I'm looking for is if this lower leg\ncan cross your waistline, parallel to your waistline. Run east and west. A lot of your are probably going to find that\nyou're going to have some restrictions here, but if you find that you have this restriction\nreally hard and feel restriction on internal rotation significantly, combined with some\nof this flexion limitation here; that would indicate to me that you've got some bony,\narthritic changes going on there. Or you've got some type of impingement or\nlabral tear. Or maybe even a bursitis, if you've got some\npain. Those are all instances where you'll want\nto get checked out for something that needs a little more qualified medical attention. That's not something you're going to fix here\nin a single video. But when we see the restrictions coming more\nfrom what we're going to find in this video – more of the capsular restrictions, things\nthat you can do something about – you're likely going to find that the restrictions\ncome in external rotation. That's exactly what we find here with Jesse. You can see his external rotation on this\nside is nowhere near getting to waistline. He's nowhere near parallel to his waist. He's not running east to west. He's got all this lack of external rotation. So, we need to try and figure out what's happening\nhere. We're going to look at the skeleton in the\neasiest of changes because we know we can do some things, just with his own posture\nand how he sets up for a squat to help alleviate that and create more room. But if that persists, you've got to start\nlooking deeper. You've got to start looking into the hip itself\nand the capsule, which we're going to do. Then, interestingly, looking at the muscles. But not just from stretching them out, but\nhow we can use the activation of those muscles – or the inactivation – that's happening\nhere, causing the tightness in the hip. So, I'm going to explain all of it step by\nstep, and we're going to start right here with the skeleton. All right, guys. Let's start off anatomically here. It's the easiest thing. The thing you can do just like this, just\nby changing position. But it helps to understand what's happening\ninside your hips when you go to squat. We should know that the one of the requirements\nis to get into hip flexion. That's what a squat is. You're getting into a deep hip flexion. You want to be at proper depth. The first thing you can do to help yourself\nis realize, in order to get into flexion you want to make sure you have external rotation\nbecause it's going to be easier to get deeper into flexion if you have external rotation\nof the hip. You can see that right here. If I were to take my hips and internally rotate\nthem like this, and then try to go into flexion, you can see I get limited in how high I can\ngo. We get bony stops here inside the acetabulum\nhere, the ball and socket of the hip. That gets cleared substantially more when\nI externally rotate the hip and I can keep going all the way up here. That's when you see kids get way down into\na deep squat. You have to externally rotate the hip to get\nthere. So, you're doing yourself a favor if you realize\nthat and you set yourself up to do that. So, the easiest way to set yourself up is\ntwofold. Number one: you take a little bit of a wider\nstance. If you go into a narrow stance squat, you're\nalready starting to cause some impingement in the hip here and the inability to get past\nthis bony block. You can see it getting stuck. It's getting stuck right here on the pelvis. But if I take my leg out wider and now, I\ngo down in there, I've cleared that. There's a clearance here. Anatomically I've created a better opportunity\nto get down. But then I could also just turn my legs out\na little bit. It's a necessary part of squatting. We talk about it all the time, guys. If you want to squat effectively and properly\nyou need to turn your legs out. Not just your feet. Your feet – it doesn’t mean anything because\nyou can turn down here and some rotation of the tibia that won't have any impact on the\nhip. It's about getting the entire leg turned out,\nkeeping those knees over the toes, and that's when you hear that because you want to keep\nthe whole leg out. So now when I go into that squat, I've got\nexternal rotation. So, if you're already having problems, let's\nsay you do this, but you still feel you've got this tightness inside; we've got to go\nto the next part here. That is examining what is going on right here\nin the hip capsule at the head of the femur in the acetabulum. So if you've tried to make those skeletal\nmodifications where you've opened up your hips, and you squat, and you're still finding\nthat you've got the tightness, and you can't really identify where it is, but you've got\nthe tightness; you've got to start looking a little deeper. Inside the joint. Again, when people start pressing here it's\nreally because they can't get to what's actually bothering them. That's the ball and socket joint. What they're talking about there is the capsule. The surrounding ligaments and structures that\nhold the hip joint together. It's like a series of seatbelts and straps\nand it kind of acts like this. If this is the ball and socket, if I have\ntight capsule over the top and you try to create movement – come on, Jesse. Get some movement. JESSE: It's tight. JEFF: Right. So, the idea is that you're limiting the freedom\nof motion here. But if I was able to use this – the head\nof the femur here – as a mobility tool to create more space by pushing into these areas\nof tightness so I loosened it, now all this freedom of motion is back. We want to restore that. We can do that very specifically here with\nJesse to try and restore that external rotation and flexion that's needed in a squat. So, what you do is take a band and anchor\nit to something behind you and then step into it on the affected side, which we know in\nthis case is Jesse's left hip. Now he anchors it up nice and high – not\ntoo high. Careful. High, and then you put yourself and your foot\nup on a box. Now, if we want to just go into flexion, which\na lot of people will have you do, they have you sink into it. What the band is doing on that high hip position\nis creating a little bit of a distraction in the hip joint to allow for some of that\nmobility. And allowing it to push into that posterior\ncapsule – the tight posterior capsule – to allow more flexion. That's the idea. You're using your own bones as tools to stretch\nout the capsule. But we can do better than that because we\nknow we need external rotation anyway. So, we can combine then because they're going\nto happen in a combined way in a squat. So, we dive down into flexion, but we allow\nthe hip to turn out because we know that external rotation is being able to do this. To turn the foot in this direction. So, the hip joint needs to go into external\nrotation. So, Jesse's not just diving straight down\ninto flexion, but he's diving into external rotation this way. Now, did you feel that? JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: It's tight. Now what we do is, you've got to make sure\nyour foot stays flat on the ground because, again, if we were to translate this over to\na squat you don’t want to just let it roll. It's not going to roll when you're squatting. Your feet still have to stay in contact with\nthe ground. So that roll would be bad. You want to keep this down and work on that\nexternal rotation – go ahead. Dive, and open. There you go. At the same time, you get the benefit of hitting\nthem both together because that's what you're going to need when you get over there. Now, this is something you want to work on,\nespecially if you're still feeling that problem when you made the modifications of your stance. But beyond that, what we need to do is look\nat another level because there could be something muscular going on, but it may not just be\nabout stretching it. More importantly, it could be about activating\nmuscles that are far away from the area of your problems. Let me show you what that means. So, here's where things get interesting because\nwe start to talk about the muscles, which is where most of us put all our attention. But it's not necessarily about the flexibility\nof the muscles. You realize there are a lot of muscles that\ncross the joint, or at least impact the hip and its motion. There are about 27 muscles that will impact\nthe motion of the hip. So, we're not necessarily looking to dissect\nthe function of every, single muscle because that would take a real scientist to do that. JESSE: Mm-hmm. JEFF: We don’t need to do that. All we want to do is look at overall motions. So, if we can't get – in your case and a\nlot of people's case who are watching – if we can't get into hip external rotation, in\ngeneral, what is probably restricted? JESSE: Your internal rotators? JEFF: Right. The stuff that's actually opposing external\nrotation. So whatever causes internal rotation of the\nhip would potentially be impacted here. In your case, if you have a limitation in\nmotion of the hip, what's interesting is, the desire to go stretch it, or stretch the\ninternal rotators in this case, is not where I would start. I would start to see if there's some kind\nof restriction caused for a reason. The number one thing your body always wants\nto do is stabilize the spine. Your spine, for good reason, is this main\nfocus because an injury to the spine could be life changing. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: So, what we want to do is always have\nstability there. Well, we know the way the joints are setup\nin the body is that the knee is a stable joint, the hip is supposed to be really mobile – the\nball and socket – but the low back needs to be stable. We alternate these stable and mobile joints. JESSE: Right. JEFF: Well, if the hip joint here is tight,\nwhy would that be? Maybe there's some instability where there\nshould be stability. JESSE: Right. JEFF: The place I look right away is the low\nback. The low back is supposed to be stable. The spine is supposed to be stable. If the spine is not stable, maybe there's\nsome compensation going on here. So, if we can wake up the muscles that are\nsupposed to be providing stability to the pelvis and the trunk, maybe the hip would\nsay, \"I can do my thing\". So, what I would do for you, I would put you\nthrough this move. I would have you get on your side here. Again, this is the tight hip. So, if this is your tight hip, I'd have you\nget in this position here and we want to say, \"Hey, what could potentially be causing some\nof that tightness of internal rotation?\" So, I'd have you get in this position here. Now I want you to perform a side bridge, but\nwhen you perform the side bridge you're going to drive through your adductors. The muscles on the inside here to try to pull\nup. JESSE: Oh, yeah. I feel that. JEFF: Okay. Now all I'm looking for is for you to hold\nthat. Awaken these muscles on the inside here that\nare driving this. This is here for support. Let's say this is too hard for you. Let's shorten it all up a little bit. Bring this up. You can even bring this in like that. Now go ahead and push. You feel it still here? JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: A little easier, but it's still getting\nthe job done here on the inside. So, if we can awaken these muscles up – now\ngo ahead and lie on your back again. If I can take the test again and go into external\nrotation, I'm a little bit better. Believe it or not. You can see this. I'm a little bit – before he had at least\na 30-degree lack here. He's closed that down a pretty good amount. If all your rotation deficit goes away then,\nyeah, you're looking at an instability problem. You're looking at this tightening here. This is trying to cause the stability that\nyou're lacking somewhere else. If you have the stability of your pelvis from\nthe other places that are supposed to do it, you wouldn't need to create this lockdown\nstability in your hip. It's supposed to be mobile. JESSE: Right. JEFF: So, when it gets more comfortable, knowing\nthat its job is free to do what it has to do, it can restore the motion. If this doesn’t clear it though, there's\none more thing that we can do. Jesse, lie on your stomach. This is where we look for overall, flat out\nweakness. I will say you're probably going to find there's\ngoing to be an element of this as well. So, for Jesse's left leg here, the first thing\nhe's going to do is bring his leg up like we did, like this. Now the first thing you want to do is test\nyour strength into rotation. So, if he lifts his foot off the ground, but\nkeeps his knee down, what is the strength there? How does it feel? JESSE: No, it's easy. JEFF: Easy? Actually, if you were to hold and I would\npress he can kind of resist me right there. Now that's his internal rotation strength. To test his external rotation, he's got to\nlift his knee off the ground. I said, 'lift his knee off the ground'. JESSE: I’m trying! JEFF: See, he can't get his knee off the ground\nvery high because he doesn't really have strength there. I don’t even have to do it with one finger. Go ahead. One finger, I could push him back down again. He's lacking external rotation strength of\nhis hip tremendously. The last thing I could do is have him try\nto lift the whole leg up. See? As soon as he does, he dives right down into\ninternal rotation. He has no strength in flexion. Lift it up again. The whole leg. In flexion with external rotation he can't\neven keep it there. So, I know he's got some weakness there and\nthat's something that we'd want to address. Things like hip mini-band walks, clamshells,\nanything we could do to strengthen the external rotators of the hip would be a good deal. The bottom line here is that there are a lot\nof causes for what's happening or why you feel tightness. The thing that's not happening here is a tightness\nin the flexors of the hip. When you go down into a squat your flexors\nare getting shortened. They're not lengthened. They're not being stretched. You don’t need to stretch them anymore. JESSE: Right. JEFF: What you need to do is figure out why\nyou're having this cause and if modifications in how you stand don’t fix it, you move\nto the next level. If modifications and stretching out that capsule\ndon’t fix it, you need to move to the next level. If the mobility or stability of this joint\nisn't really affecting what you do, isn't really getting to the bottom of it by fixing\nthat inactivation of the muscles that are opposing what you're trying to do, you need\nto move to the next level. If the weakness is there – let's say there\nis no weakness there and you test out strong where Jesse failed miserably, you need to\nmove to the next level. Guess what that next level is? Stretching the hip. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: It comes last. Stretching the muscles of the hip are going\nto be the least impactful, when it comes to getting to the root of why you're feeling\nthat tightness or having restriction when you get to the bottom of the squat. Guys, I hope you've found this video helpful. In the meantime, if you're looking for programs\nwhere we put the science back in strength because, as you can see, these things matter\nand there's a progression to what you should be doing in every step of the game. You want to assess what it is after you've\nmade a change and go from there. Not just keep doing the same things all the\ntime, expecting a different result. Our programs are based on that. If you head to ATHLEANX.com right now you\ncan find the program that's best suited to your goals. In the meantime, if you haven't already, please\nsubscribe and turn on your notifications so you never miss a video when we put one out. Make sure to leave your comments and thumbs\nup below. Let me know what else I can cover for you\nto try and help you guys in your training and take you to that next level. All right, guys. I'll be back here again soon. See ya."
