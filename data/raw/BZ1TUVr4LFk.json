    "transcript": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nBy the end of today's video, I want to help you   to squat and squat better. You see most often the \nthings that you get wrong in a squat you're not   even aware of. I identify ten of the most common \nmistakes that people make when they're squatting,   and I'm going to make sure that we fix \nthem today. So, with that being said,   let's start breaking them down one by one. \nNow, before you go to say, But, Jeff, I can't   squat because when I do, my knees hurt or my back \nhurts or insert body part hurts. The good news is   there's always a variation of a squat that you \ncan perform. And even better news is that most   everything I'm showing you here in this video \nis going to apply no matter what version of the   squat you choose. So whatever version of the squat \nyou pick, the first big mistake is, how wide are   your feet? Are you a narrow squatter, a shoulder \nwidth squatter, or an extra wide squatter? \n  And again, how would you even know? If you want \nto perform the best squat you've got to know and   for that I have a way to help you with the stance \nfinder. And all you have to do is lay on your back   and simply pull your knees up towards your chest \nand try to find the point that allows for the most   hip flexion without causing an excessive \nrounding of the low back, because you   don't want that at the bottom of the squat.\nSo, you simply just kind of pull up on your legs   and find that comfortable spot. Maybe narrow, \nfeels better for you. Maybe rotating your hips   out a little bit allows you for that deeper hip \nflexion and feels more comfortable. Once you find   that spot, you just want to line your lower legs \nup with your femur, simply stand up and then from   there just tweak your stance an inch or so in or \nout to make it feel ultimately comfortable. And   of course, just squat down and reinforce it, \nand you've chosen the right squat with. \n  So now I mentioned fine tuning. What that means \nis what are you going to do now with your feet are   going to point them out a little bit or maybe \nturn them in a little bit? Well, it's pretty   generally accepted that a little bit of outward \nrotation of the foot is going to create more room   inside of the hip joint when you go deeper. \nAnd also, to get a better job of recruiting   the adductors at the bottom of the squat to help \nyou to power back up. But if you forget to remove   the rest of your leg in addition to your foot, \nyou're asking for problems, mostly because you're   creating torque issues here at the knee. \nSee, if you turn your foot out and you leave your   knees straight ahead and you move them forward, \nyou can get a disruption of that tracking,   creating a whole mess of problems here for the \npatella. So, what I say is stop worrying about   rotating your feet and instead of worry about \nrotating your knees. If you move your knees out,   your foot will come with it, as will the hip, \nso now you don't have that torque being created,   so pain free squatting becomes a reality \ninstead of being something out of reach. \n  Mistake number three hat you're making is you're \ntoo obsessed with not allowing your knees to go   past your toes when you squat. Maybe you heard it \nbefore, but the problem is you have to if you're   going to get to proper depth. And the reason for \nthat is because we need that lower leg to be able   to go forward if we're going to maintain proper \nmechanics to the squat. You see when we're going   down, we can't lift our foot off the ground to \ncreate the dorsiflexion needed to get a deeper   squat because our foot has to stay in contact \nwith the ground. But we can create dorsiflexion   by allowing that tibia to move forward in \nrelation to the foot. And in order to do that,   it's going to have to track more and more forward \nagain towards your toes. Guys, it's unavoidable,   just let it happen naturally. And if you do, your \nsquats do not only feel better, but you're going   to have better mechanics up and down.\nMistake number four when squatting is not   keeping the chest and the pelvis linked throughout \nthe exercise. Not only does this create a more   inefficient and less powerful squat, but it also \nleads directly to the squat morning. We know how   ugly this can be and it's also quite bad for your \nback. You can avoid this, however, by just simply   thinking about the chest and the pelvis as one \nunit and moving them in space at the same time.   It's quite simple because these are pretty big \nmoving targets and pretty easy to control. \n  It becomes most challenging at the bottom of the \nsquat, where there's a tendency to allow the hips   to move first, thereby breaking that link between \nthe two. However, if you do this and do it right,   not only does this lead to, as I said, a more \nefficient squat, but one with a straighter   bar path and a straight bar path is a good \nsquat and one you're going to want to try to   emulate every time you get onto the bar. \nInterestingly, one of the biggest allies that   you have to create and maintain that relationship \nbetween the chest and the pelvis is a muscle that   oftentimes gets overlooked in the squat and it's \nthe lats. And that leads to mistake number five,   you're not creating and maintaining enough lat \ntightness. And the easiest way to do this is to   simply imagine trying to break this bar over your \nback. If you do that, you're pulling your elbows   down into your sides, activating and engaging \nthose lats which creates that rigidity of the   torso. Now, no, it doesn't lead directly from the \nchest to the pelvis. We know that the last will   attach from the arm to the pelvis, but it still \nmaintains that lateral support needed to create   that rigid torso, create that efficient squat and \nlead to a better overall squat in the end. \n  And so squat mistake number six is \nactually a fairly obvious one and that is   you're using one of these. \nOh, you mean a pad. \n  Don't you just want to be squatting? \nYeah, you're in the way actually. \n  Get out of here please. \nOkay. \n  But let's discuss this guys is actually I have \na problem with it, but for a far less offensive   reason. We're talking more about the anatomy of \nthis and see what happens when you put this on   the bar as you're creating a really thick bar. And \nthat bar has very few options to sit comfortably   on your back. You can't put it in a low bar \nposition because it feels like it's just going   to roll off and most people won't even attempt it. \nThe only place it wants to naturally sit is right   here on C7. C7 is the last cervical vertebrae \nand it does want to sit sort of right on there   because it's comfortably carried right there.\nThe problem is it's not going to stay comfortable   for long because the compression on there could \nactually lead to numbness and tingling down the   arm into those fourth and fifth fingers and it \njust doesn't make squatting a really enjoyable   experience. The fact is, guys, if you ditch this \nand get used to putting the bar on your back,   you're going to be able to find a \nmore optimal position without the   downsides that come along with that pad. \nMistake number seven is actually forgetting   from time to time to step out from under the \nbar and do some unilateral exercises. You see   exercises like the Bulgarian Split Squat or even \na Step Up or a Lunge. Do a great job of not only   helping you to identify those imbalances in the \nfirst place, but game plan for working on them.   You'd be surprised at the difference in strength \nlevels that you have in your right and left leg   right now. We're able to actually assess that \nwith force plays, but what do you do if you   don't have access to something like that? \nWell, you could actually see it in the form   of the dreaded hip shift at the bottom of \nthe squat. You've probably seen it before.   You slide a little bit to one side or the other as \nyou work your way back up to the top of every rep.   It's happening because you're just simply trying \nto find that stronger leg, but it comes at a cost.   Usually in the form of a hip impingement or worse, \na labral tear, all of which would be preventable   if you simply just learn to incorporate some \nadditional exercises into your routine.\n  And so, mistake number eight is one that I \nknow all too well, unfortunately, especially   more these days than when I was younger. And \nit's not properly warming up to squat. And so,   we've all been there either because we are short \non time or maybe long on ego, where our idea of   a warmup consisted of unzipping our gym bag, \nonly to realize just moments later that maybe   you weren't really warmed up enough. The fact is, \nguys, if you're looking to get your body ready   to perform something like a squat, you've got to \nmake sure you take at least some time to prepare   your body to do it. If you're looking for a great \nsquat warm up, you're going to definitely want to   check out this video that I put together. I will \nlink it for you at the end of this video. \n  So, mistake number nine is a big one. And \nit's when we seek out those big squat totals   with a body that's not necessarily ready to do \nit. You see people pile the plates on in a rush   to get to bigger and stronger numbers. However, if \nyou built these numbers upon a cracked foundation,   then how strong are you really? And that's what \nI try to preach all the time. You don't want to   build just strength, you want to build true \nstrength, absolute strength. In the case of   someone like Jesse, sure, maybe it takes a little \nbit longer in order to make sure that we're doing   this the right way. But in the end of the game, \nwhen you still have impressive strength totals   and you've done it the right way, you've not \nonly gotten stronger, but you've built it upon   a foundation that's less likely to crack right \nat the very moment that you need it the most.\n  Mistake number ten is actually one of the biggest \nsquat mistakes you can make. And the reason why   it's actually so problematic is because it's very \ndeceptive. It happens from the moment you put the   bar on your back. I made a whole video on how \nto identify whether you're doing it. I want you   to make sure that you check it out. It will be \nincredibly helpful, and it'll set the stage for   success with all these other tips. If you're \nlooking for a program, guys, you can find it   over at Athleanx.com. If you haven't done so, \nmake sure you click Subscribe and turn on your   Notifications, so you never miss a new video when \nwe put one out. All right, guys. See you soon. \n  Fine tune and adjust your stance just an inch or \ntwo out and then from there simply--oh, fuck.  "
