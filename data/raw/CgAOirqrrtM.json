    "transcript": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nJesse Laico, Athleanx.com. \n  What is this stance? What is this? \nWhat?\n  This tricep thing going on?\nOh, I'm I got to show off the   angles. You know, being skinny guy, you \ngot to show off what you got, right?\n  You can relax. It's okay.\nOkay. \n  So listen, let's talk about skinny guys though, \nbecause that is the subject of the video. Skinny   guys like Jesse or formerly skinny guys.\nFormerly skinny. \n  Bulking up now, of course, through his hard work. \nWe focus, though, on arms because a lot of times   the arms will lag even in terms of development \nas the rest of you grows. Jesse still had   arms that were a little bit on the thin side. So, \ntoday we're going to go through a workout that   we use to help to start to grow those things \nthat even when he doesn't have to flex them.   Then I want to show you guys, too, we're going to \nintroduce a new format here, and the new format is   let's go through it together. So, Jesse and \nI are both going to go through this work out   and show you the footage as I commentate on what's \nactually going on. So that being said, let's jump   right into the workout with the first exercise.\nAnd we kick this workout off here for our biceps,   at the wall, for our strict curl, cheat curl \ncombo, which is actually something I went over   and through, painfully through, with the great \nC.T. Fletcher right here against this very wall.   It didn't get any easier here today. So, what \nwe do is we focus on picking up a weight that's   going to be challenging, that's going to get \nus in the five to six rep range or so.\n  Okay, and what we want to focus on is making sure \nthat in the strict curl that you're not relying on   momentum. So, what's nice about this is that the \nwall serves as the feedback to prevent the extra   momentum because you have to keep the back of your \nhead, your upper back and your butt in contact   with the wall throughout the entire set. \nRight. \n  But then what we do is we step away from there, so \nwe turn this into an immediate sort of super set.   I give myself about 10 seconds only to put the \nbar down, shake my arms out, get right back into   it again and now utilize the momentum that I can \nhave here to allow me to continue to kind of cheat   through some additional reps. Not to sacrifice \nform entirely, but just to allow the momentum   to put me in a position to have another eccentric, \noverloaded rep. Because I've talked about many   times before, the eccentric lowering of the weight \nis one of the most important things you can do.   If you want to start building up those biceps, \nyou really got to apply that eccentric overload,   and this is a way for me to sort of concentric \ncheat it up and then slow it on the way down. \n  Right. \nOf course, now Jesse,   when he takes over and does the same thing--\nMuch lighter weight, mind you.\n  Whatever, he's still doing the same thing. \nHe's feeling the same thing that I'm feeling   just at a different level. He has a \nlittle bit of a more narrow grip.\n  Yeah, I did that because it felt a little \nbit more comfortable on my wrist.\n  So, with the easy bar, you have that option \nto either go narrow or go wide. I like to go   a little bit wider. \nYeah. \n  Now again, what are you thinking here as you--it \nfeels a lot harder to keep that strict form,   you don't realize how much you \nuse momentum and cheat. \n  No, you really don t. Until you have to keep \nyourself braced up against the wall that whole   time, you don't have any idea what it's like \nto actually strictly move that weight up.\n  Then you step away from the wall.  \nThen I move into the cheat curl,   and you know that that eccentric overload, like \nyou were saying, that feels like nothing else.\n  That's just the first exercise in the workout, \nthere's more to come. As a matter of fact,   your favorite right here. And that is a \ncombination exercise that's actually part Waiter   Curl and part Spider Curl. Your favorite? \nThe Waiter Curl for sure, 30 days worth. \n  Thirty days worth. \nJesse actually did this one exercise for 30 days.   Here's the deal we get an incline bench, we get \ninverted on top of it with a single dumbbell,   with our hands cuffed underneath it. And what \nwe have here is the benefits of the Spider Curl,   which places the bicep in that peak contracted \nstate at the top something different than we   get from the normal strength curve of a Standing \nDumbbell Curl. And we get to take that forearms   out of it that sometimes tend to dominate \nthe curl, especially as we get fatigued. So,   we have the dumbbell allowing our wrist to sort of \nbend back and all we're focusing on is getting the   top of that dumbbell lifted straight up towards \nthe ceiling. And you can see when Jesse steps in   here too, he's getting the same sort of overloaded \neffect here. And again, this is something that's   not just what you're doing here. In other words, \nyou've been working on obviously building up your   physique by building up your strength and all the \nbig lifts. Everybody has seen your deadlift and   your squat, but how does this fit in?\nWell, you know, is it part of my overall   training to be stronger? No. But \nis it because I want to get bigger   arms? Yeah. I want to improve my physique. \nAnd so, this is what I do to help that.\n  And it's okay to have these overlapping goals. \nIf you want to have bigger arms, you can still   do this as an accessory to what you're doing \nin terms of building up your strength. \n  Yup.\nIn this case, here we're doing   three sets of about 8 to 10 repetitions, and that \nbrings us to the final exercise for our biceps in   this arm workout. And this is something I love \nI covered before, it's called the Cross Body   Hammer Curl. So, Jesse, here's a quiz \nfor you, let's put you to work here. \n  Let's hear it. \nWhat am I actually trying to   work here with the Cross Boy Hammer Curl?\nOh, I know it's this is your brachialis. \n  Ok, hotshot. Now why are we working \nthe brachialis at this point?\n  Because it gives a little bit more depth front \nto back or side to side, I should say.\n  So, it s filling your shirt sleeves \nsort of the width of your arms? \n  Yes. \nRight? So that's   a good thing at goal. Again, if your goal was \nesthetic base, try to fill your shirt sleeves,   this is why we do what we do. Now, I'll throw this \nin here. The pronated position of the forearm acts   to sort of minimize some of the bicep contribution \nas a supinator. So, what we get is this increased   focus on the flexion of the elbow, which is \ngoing to shift the focus to that brachialis. \n  Right. \nAll right, so with the   science out of the way, what does it feel like \nnow when you're doing your version of this?\n  When I do the exercise, I \nusually feel pretty good. I mean,   sometimes it's a little melancholy.\nI m talking about what you're actually   feeling in the muscle you're working. \nWe don't want to know about Jesse--\n  Really? Okay. \n--on a mood meter. \n  Really, OK? And the mood\nOn the mood meter?\n  Well, I definitely feel more activation \nof the brachialis than I do the bicep.\n  By the way, why are you melancholy? You're making \nthese gains, should be nothing but happy.\n  There are some mean people out there.\nThat's true. Mean commentors too. \n  Mean commentors. \nSo, you're feeling the brachialis work.\n  Yes. \nAll right. And   you're kind of getting that pump that you get to \nkind of round out the rest of this workout.\n  Right. It's not just up and \ndown, it's more side to side.\n  So, what we do here is two to three sets \nof a little bit higher rep range here,   10 to 12 on each arm to wrap up the first half \nof the workout, which brings us to the triceps.   And so, the bicep portion of the workout started \nwith a more compound or heavier, loaded lift.   We're going to do the same thing here, but \nwe're actually going to change the focus around.   If the bicep started strict and then allowed us to \nuse a little bit of momentum after, this actually   goes in the opposite direction. We're going \nto start with a little bit of extra assistance   here through some momentum that then goes into \nmore of a strictness to the second part. \n  And the first part you're seeing me do here is the \nLying Tricep Extension, but we do it a little bit   of an extra stretch on the long head. So, as I \nget down to the bottom of every repetition here,   I'm allowing the arms to sink just a little bit \nto apply a little bit more of that stretch on   the long head to help with that recruitment and \nto power this bar up to the top. As soon as I'm   done with this half of the exercise, though, \nI don't stop. I go right into the second half,   and this is a JM Press or at least a JM Press \nmodification. It's a little bit harder to do these   at this point, again, in the fatigued state \nwhere you're simply just letting the hands almost   drop now with a target being your front delts \nrather than anywhere back behind your head. Yes,   I'm getting some assistance from the shoulders \nand the chest to do this, but because of the   tight positioning of my elbows, most of the \nwork here is being done by the triceps. \n  Yup.\nSo then when you pick up the bar   and you do this again, what are you feeling, \nespecially with the stretch part here?\n  Yeah, I really noticed a stretch in \nthe muscle at the bottom of the rep,   which not only feels like solid activation, but \nI think it really lets me use some momentum to   power the weight up overhead. With the JM Press \nmodification, I would only be handling a little   bit more weight here, but with pre-fatiguing of \nthe muscles, it makes the lighter weight for a   little bit more challenging and requires them to \nwork a little bit harder, despite the fact that   the weight has been lowered a little bit.\nSo going pretty heavy here in the six to   eight rep range in the first half. And again, \nhowever many you can get in the second half,   three sets of this. That brings us to the second \nexercise here and our tricep portion of the   workout, and it's my favorite variation of the \nPushdown, we call the Rocking Pushdown. Something   I've covered here before, and the main goal \nhere is to try to keep that rope perpendicular   to the forearm for the entire duration of the \nPushdown. That's something that doesn't happen   on a typically performed stationary version of \na Pushdown. But you can see when I start here,   that rope is perpendicular to my forearms, placing \nas much tension as I can on the triceps and as I   rock back at the end, I'm still maintaining \nas much of a relationship of that rope,   that perpendicular relationship, to my forearms \nat the bottom. So, I still have high tension on   the triceps throughout the entire range of motion. \nJesse when you do this, what are you feeling?  \n  Do you mind if I take over \non this one really quick? \n  Yeah, sure, go ahead. What are you feeling? \nAll right, what s going on guys. So today we're   going to talk about this Pushdown here where \nyou get the bicep activate--I mean--\n  That's not the bicep.\n--the tricep activation with the   with the brachialis and the elbow joint.\nThat's not the brachialis.\n  And so, you're going to come here and \nyou're going to pull it down to here--\n  Did you--can you bring Jesse back please?\nOh shit. Okay.\n  So, Jesse.\nYes?\n  What did you like most about the exercise?\nWell, I like most about the exercise is how well   I can actually feel the tension in the tricep when \nI'm performing it. Sometimes I feel like when I do   a regular Pushdown, I kind of get a little bit \nof extra engagement of my shoulders or my chest   because probably I'm doing it wrong. But when I do \nthis version of the Pushdown, I really do feel it   in my triceps and it's a good feedback.\nIt helps to keep the elbows a little bit   tighter to the side, which is always \ngoing be a good thing for getting more   tricep engagement. Three sets of 10 to 12 here. We \ngot one exercise left and it too is a combo. \n  And to wrap it up, we go for that light exercise, \nthe one that people like to relegate to the   dumpster. They don't like to do the exercise, \nbut it matters. It's the Tricep Kickback. And   we're not just going to stick there, we're \nactually going to combine it with another   exercise done immediately after. So, as you \ncan see, when I do the kickback here, I like   to do them on an incline bench that I lay face \ndown on because I take away any of the rocking   or momentum that might be generated if I were to \ndo this standing. I've done them standing before   and I like them that way. But this is a way that \nI can really sort of hone in on performing these   without that momentum. And the key here is keeping \nthose elbows as far back behind my body as I can,   because what I want to do is put that \nlong head in its peak contracted state.\n  In order to get that, the arm has to \nbe back into extension behind the body.   But I'm not finished entirely. As soon as I'm done \nwith that half, I come back down to the ground   and I perform one of my favorite bodyweight \nexercises that also tends to get the arm into   more extension than, let's say, something like a \ndiamond cutter pushup. It's a push of variation,   we call this the Cobra Pushup. And I'm trying to \nget my chest out in front of me as much as I can,   so as I mentioned, that arm can stay sort of \nin as close to an extended position as I can   during a Pushup. \nRight. \n  And again, I rep this out as much as I can until \nI can't do any more. I'm doing two to three   sets. First half I m choosing about a 10 to 12 \nfailure rate, and then I go into straight failure   not knowing how many I'm going to be able to \ndo, especially at this point in the workout. \n  Why is it that people don t like the kickbacks? \nI think the kickback is a great exercise, and I   think it's great for building your triceps.\nI mean, as you can see here, you're not using   very heavy weights. I think some people get \na little bit embarrassed about the ways that   they can handle on this exercise. And there \nis an insufficiency built into the exercise   that doesn't even allow you to use a lot of \nweight on it. However, it doesn't make it   a bad exercise to just sort of have to embrace the \nfact that the weights won't be as heavy as you're   used to in other exercises, but they're playing \na very important role here to place that tricep   in its peak contracted position, particularly, \nlike I said on the long head. And then come   back and complement it with one more body weight \nburn out. And so with that, guys, there's the arm   workout that Jesse's has been doing here to try to \nbuild up his arms and I think successfully so.\n  I think they're looking pretty good.\nIn addition to the strength that you're   building. Nice work. \nThank you. \n  If you want to do the same workout, \nguys, you can follow along step by step,   follow the sets and reps.
