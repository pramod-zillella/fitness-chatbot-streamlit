    "transcript": "So, your buddy just texted you and he \nleft you high and dry for today's workout.   You're on your own. That is, until I \nreplace him with someone much better.   Today, I'm going to give you the opportunity \nto train with your dream workout partner   and it gets to be one of these six \nguys. Who is your pick going to be? \n  What's up guys Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nWhat you see behind me is six of the most   iconic action heroes of all time. Each instantly \nrecognizable even if you didn't have the great   fortune to grow up in the 80s and 90s like \nI did. However, today they're more than   that. They're your workout partner and you \nget to pick which one you want to replace   that lame workout partner with. And we're going \nto help you to do so by defining and grading   each of them in four different categories. \nSo, we all know that a good training partner has   the ability to motivate you, right? To push you \nto do things that maybe you don't want to do.   Which one of these guys do you think \nhas the ability to best push you   to get to that next level? The second category \nwe have to look at is their physique and what   is the one that matches your goal the best. \nEverybody's going to have a different pick here,   but I want you to make sure that you're picking \nbased upon the physique that you want.\n  The third category here is their training style. \nAnd believe it or not, each of these guys,   though they all look really good, have a \ndifferent approach to how they got the job done.   Which one matches up best with how you prefer to \ntrain? And then finally, the fourth category is   that X Factor, right? Which of these guys, if \nyou had only one choice, would be the one that   you want to hang out with? Could be because you \njust liked their movies more than others or it   could be because you simply just think that they \nhave the best likability. We're going to rank them   from 0 to 10. Again, these ratings are based on \nmy personal preferences, but I want you to be   able to go through the same rating scale and \ndetermine who your pick is going to be. Make   sure you leave them in the comments below. \nAnd so, we kick off this list with maybe one   of the most popular martial artists of all time. \nWe're talking about Jean-Claude Van Damme. And now   look, this is a guy that actually people wanted \nto be like. I remember when his movies came out,   people would dress like him. When I posted this \non Instagram, my buddy Chris Daughtry sent me   a picture showing me just how bad he wanted \nto be Van Damme when he was a kid. I mean,   he damn near pulled it off. But when it \ncomes to motivation, this is a guy that   I never really thought was someone that's \ngoing to scream at me during a workout.   Well, there's that, but I just don't know how \nfunctional that will be during, let's say,   a bench press. So, for me, he gets an \neight in the motivation category. \n  Now as far as physique, he had everything \nI was looking for at 5 10 176 pounds,   he was highly relatable to me. He had that \nmuscle definition in size almost to perfection   and of course epitomizing what Athlean-X is \nabout. If you want to look like an athlete,   you got to train like one. Van Damme, of \ncourse, is an athlete with an athlete's body,   he gets a 10 as far as his physique goal. Now when \nwe were talking about his training style, you're   talking about someone who was an athlete first \nand actor second, so his training reflected that.   This is a guy who was a black belt by the age of \n18, a competitive kickboxer internationally, and   also had a five-year ballet career, so he had all \nthe attributes of a high-level athlete. However,   he did have an appreciation for bodybuilding and \nalso competed in bodybuilding in his teens. The   workouts he favored were ones where he could put \ntwo muscle groups together in the same workout,   but also have room for kickboxing and \nof course, his all-important stretching.   And we all know how good Van Damme was at \nstretching. Now these workouts were done on   every other day basis, leaving room for his \nconditioning, which is something that I do   and a lot of our Athlean-X programs. So \nhere we definitely align with our training   styles and for that he gets a solid nine. \nNow when it comes to the final X Factor here,   I have a confession to make. I was never really \none of the Van Damme guys. I know a lot of you out   there are. However, for me, I always found his \nmovies to be just a little bit cheesy. Doesn't   mean I didn't watch them though, but if I had to \nchoose a single training partner, he just wouldn't   really get that X factor for me, so we round \nout his score with a seven in that category. \n  Next, we have Dolph Lundgren, a guy who I grew up \nwanting to hate because of course, what he did to   Apollo Creed. But now we have a different set of \nstandards here. Is he going to be the guy that I   train with? And when it comes to motivation and \nthe ability to motivate me, I kind of think he   could do this. And the reason why I actually \nsay this is you might think that, oh, well,   he's kind of a stoic, quiet guy, but I actually \nknow better. You see, I've trained with Florian   Munteanu, who played Drago's son in the Creed \nII movie, and he told me something about him.\n  He said, He can train us all under the table at \nhis current age right now. He's a badass still   to this day and also a very likable guy, but \nhas the ability to push you and motivate you   all the way to your last rep. I'm going to \ngive him a nine in this category. Of course,   there's nothing to not like about Dolph \nLundgren's physique, but the thing about it was,   from a reliability standpoint, there wasn't much \nfor me because we're talking about a guy who was   6 5 245 pounds. Yeah, I would like to look \nlike that, but I never will. So, for that,   I just didn't really have a high reliability, so \nI had an eight point five in this category. \n  Now, as far as his training style, there's another \nguy who's an example of being an athlete first,   an actor's second. And when we talk about athlete, \nthis guy was competing at a high level from the   age of seven and all the way into his twenties, \nDolph was competing internationally in both karate   and judo with most of his training focusing \non how to improve and be the best in sport.   It wasn't until the opportunity for Rocky IV \ncame along that he switched his training focus.   And what happened here was a couple of things. \nFirstly, he kind of shelved his athletic training   in favor of almost exclusively bodybuilding \ntraining at this point. And he did so on a push   pull leg split, which we know I'm a big fan of.\nHe did a six-day continuous push, pull legs,   push, pull legs with a repeated day off on \nSunday, however, he would choose three to   four exercises per muscle group with four \nsets per exercise and then six to 12 reps   on every set. This is what's been reported, but \nif it's accurate, it's too much volume for me.   I would not have the ability to recover from that \ntype of volume so while we get the extra points   for having the right split, we don't get points \nfor the amount of volume. And we certainly don't   get the points for the fact that we had to shelve \nthe athletic training altogether. I think there's   a way we can incorporate both, so I give him \nthe seven in the training style category. \n  Now lastly, as we get to the X Factor here, \nthough, admittedly he gave me nightmares as   a child, I still have that appeal of wanting to \nactually make that workout happen with Florian,   so I'm going to give him a good \nsolid eight in this category. \n  So, let's stick with the Rocky theme now and \ntalk about Carl Weathers. Another one of those   guys that I didn't really start off liking but of \ncourse became a big fan of when he went and helped   out Rocky. Now, all you had to do, though, is \nwatch that training scene in Rocky III to realize   what an amazing motivator Apollo could be. If I \nhad one guy that I needed screaming in my ear to   make sure I could get that final rep done, he's \nthe guy to go to. And for that I'm going to give   him a solid 10 in the motivation category. \nAs far as the physique, this is another one of   those guys that represents everything that I \nwanted, right? The perfect amount of muscle mass   and leanness, except that at 6 2 220, again, \nhere's a guy that was a little bit bigger than   I could relate to. So, for that, I have to give \nhim a little bit of a notch down. but again,   still a solid nine and a half. As far as the \ntraining style, he did something very interesting.   He teamed up with Vince Gironda to do something \ncalled Peripheral Heart Action Training, which is   a style of training that works your total body in \none workout sequentially, one exercise after the   next with no rest in between. And the desired \noutcome here was to help you to burn fat and   build muscle at the same time, doing a little bit \nbetter job at burning fat than building muscle.   That being said, he would do these workouts for \nseven consecutive rounds, which is a lot more   than anybody else that Vince was training, they \nwould usually cap out at four or five rounds.\n  All sets were performed for 12 repetitions, \nsometimes with weights that were very light   to get the benefits of that cardiovascular \nconditioning. And sometimes on the heavier end,   even to the point where he would rest, pause \nhis way to the 12 reps with the goal here   being to kind of put on more size. Though this is \nsomething Carl has said many times he never had a   problem with. Well, I can't really relate to that \nin a total body workout for me is going to look a   lot different. And for that reason, it's going to \nbe a seven and a half in the training style. \n  And finally, for that X factor, whether it's \nAction Jackson or Predator, I always kind of   looked at Carl Weathers as just a bad man, \nyou know, someone that you'd want to have   your back in a bar fight. But for all these \nreasons, for me, he's going to get a solid   score of eight in that X Factor category. \nFourth up is going to be first up on many people's   list for the person that they want to train with. \nAnd I have to say, who wouldn't want to train with   Arnold? When it comes to motivation, again, I got \nanother guy who's sitting up there at the very top   with a solid 10. I know he could get me \nto do something that I didn't want to do.   I know that if I'm in a workout and he asked me \nto do something, even if he did it very politely,   I never want to disappoint him and of course, \nI would give him my A-plus effort. So,   for that, I'm going to give him the 10. \nNow, when it comes to the physique goal, I've   got to be honest here, although I always wanted to \nbe Arnold, I knew from day one I'd never look like   Arnold. All I had to do was look in the mirror at \nmy chest even now and I don't see that. And I knew   that I didn't have the genetics to ever be him. \nAt 6 3 , 235, again, he felt too far out of reach   for me. So, while he had everything in perfect \nproportion, I have to give him an eight and a half   here because there is just no relatability for me, \nthough it might be vastly different for you. \n  Now when it to the training style, again, \nwhat was there not to like about Arnold?   Arnold set the standard for training. He had an \nentire encyclopedia of bodybuilding that he put   out that of course, I had not just one copy of, \nbut two. He had a variety of different splits,   but he always did have a foundation and dedication \nto not just the esthetics of bodybuilding but   building up that foundational strength. Which \nI know is a training for professional athletes,   is going to apply to and benefit and any \nsingle person that steps in front of me.\n  So, with his golden six exercises \nfocusing on a priority of progressively   overloading on the squat, bench, pullups \nor weighted pullups, the military press,   barbell curls and weighted crunches Arnold \nknew how to build that base foundation   and set the stage for performance. However, the \none lack here, was that there wasn't really a   whole hell of a lot of athletic performance to \nfollow. So, while he had the right training to set   the stage for it, he didn't necessarily take that \nnext step into the athleticism. So, for that, he   gets a good solid nine, but not a perfect 10. \nAnd then of course, when it comes to the X Factor,   I don't know, call me just a fan of \nhis movies, but I always liked Arnold   Schwarzenegger. I would always want to be in his \npresence. If I had a chance to train with him,   you could never go wrong with him as a \ntraining partner. So, for that, he's got   to get a solid 10 in the X Factor category. \nSo, I said at the beginning how Jean-Claude   Van Damme was one of the most popular martial \narts of our time. Well, at least my time. But   the traditionalist will remind me, son, you're \njust not going back far enough in time, because   we've got to start talking about guys like Bruce \nLee or in this case, Chuck Norris. And there's no   doubt that Chuck Norris was an athlete first, \nyet again and an actor's second. But when it   comes to motivation, as badass as he is, I kind \nof always looked at him as like the nice guy,   right? He always seemed friendly. I know he \ncould kick my ass seven ways till Sunday,   but he just seemed nice. And I don't know \nif he'd be the right guy to get me really   digging deep to perform my next set, so I have to \ngive him a seven in the motivation category. \n  And now when it comes to the physique goal \ncategory, now listen again, preferences are   individual. And for me, I never really wanted \nto look like Chuck Norris. He just didn't have   the amount of muscularity or definition that I was \nseeking. Now, it's not to say that he didn't look   good or is not a good goal for a lot of people, \nhe just wasn't necessarily my goal. And I have to   admit that as a young kid, he always seemed to be \nsort of the older guy. You know, I had that stupid   anybody older than 30 mentality is an old man. And \nof course, of the bunch we talked about so far,   he seemed like the old guy to me. So, when it \ncomes to physique, I just didn't really match up   with him and I have to give him a five there.\nNow, when we're talking about the training style,   however, once again, we're talking about an \nathlete first. So normally I would prefer the   training style, but there are some key differences \nhere that make me diverge a little bit. Look,   you can never belittle the accomplishments \nin the competitive arena in both jujitsu   and judo. The problem was his focus was always on \nthe martial arts. And though he knew that weight   training was an important component of his overall \nperformance, he never really prioritized it. And   in fact, when he did try to prioritize it and \nactually start to lift heavier, he experienced   some injuries. Namely one shoulder injury that \nkind of knocked them back quite a bit and changed   his entire outlook on weight training and what \nrole it really needed to play for him. And here   is where he sort of put it in that sort of adjunct \nrehab and/or prehab focus. And believe it or not,   though, he later on became famous for the total \ngym, he was actually exposed to this device many   years prior to its release. And he was using this \nbecause he felt like it gave him the ability to,   yeah, improve his strength as he moved his \nown body in space. But more importantly,   it was kind to his joints, and it allowed him to \nstill perform at a high level without detracting   from his performance as a martial artist.\nThat being said, there focus not necessarily   ever being on the progressively loading aspect \nof weight training is where we sort of diverge.   And though I know that choosing the wrong \nexercises are likely going to get you hurt,   there are a lot of exercises out there \nthat are not going to do that. And for me,   I have to just give him a six in terms of the \ncongruence between my training approach and his.   And when it comes to that X factor, can we all \njust agree that even though he does smile a lot,   I bet you can probably kill me with a smile, too. \nThe fact is, when we talk about Chuck Norris,   they're sayings about him for crying out loud. He \ndoesn't do pushups, but he pushes the ground down.   He's got to get just that bad ass number nine \nhere when we talk about the X Factor category. \n  And last but certainly not least, we have to talk \nabout Sly, Sylvester Stallone. And when we talk   about motivation, here's the interesting fact. \nI don't even need to train with them for him to   motivate me. All I have to do is watch any one of \nthe Rocky movies, which I probably done 500 times   apiece, and I'm going to be fired up to do my \nnext workout, or I just have to simply listen to   the Rocky IV soundtrack and I'm going to get the \nsame result. So right here, I'm going to give him,   of course, a 10 in the motivation category. \nNow, when it comes to the physique goal category,   he was exactly who I wanted to look like. When I \nset out on day one of who I wanted to look like,   it was Sylvester Stallone. And the reason for it \nwas there is a high degree of relatability. Now,   granted, I grew up an Italian kid, and of course, \nthe Italian Stallion had a certain appeal to me.   But beyond that, we're talking about 5 10 , 173 \npounds, once again, certainly within my reach for   someone that I wanted to look like. And again, \nwe're talking about the perfect blend between   the right amount of size and the right amount \nof definition. I just always aspired exactly   to look like him. I mean, look, I even dressed \nlike him and hung posters of him in my basement   at least I had my goal set from the very \nbeginning at a very early age. He's going   to get a 10 for the physique goal for me. \nNow, when it comes to the training style,   it's well documented that Sly was an \navid bodybuilder, right? He knew how   important it was to esthetically look a certain \nway to make an impact on camera. So, he sought   out guys like Franco Columbo to train him as a \nbodybuilder, but it didn't mean that he didn't   pursue the athletic part of his job as well. He \nknew that being in Rocky was going to require him   to learn how to box. He knew that he had to do \nsome important fight choreography in order to make   that look a certain way. You need a certain level \nof athleticism and coordination to be able to pull   that off convincingly and he did that. Of course, \neven the skills of the boxer, his jump rope   ability, he had a high degree of athleticism that \nhe worked on in conjunction with his training. \n  Now, what did the training look like? Well, as any \neffective bodybuilder would do, he would vary his   splits, but he landed most often on an upper lower \nalternating day split. So upper body one day,   followed by lower body and he did this three \ntimes for a total of six workouts in the week.   With the right selection of exercises, you \ncan actually disperse that volume responsibly   between, let's say, the anterior chain and \nposterior chain, but still get the frequency   needed to create the muscle gains that you're \nlooking for. All the while, like I mentioned,   still having the ability to perform athletically \nas he did, especially with all that extra boxing   and ring work guys. For me, his training style \nis going to get a solid nine point five. \n  Now when it comes to The X Factor here, guys, \nI think I probably already showed my bias. But,   you know, this is a subjective list, so we're \nall entitled to one. But I will tell you this,   Sylvester Stallone is and always will be my \nmain inspiration for what I do. He's the reason   why I started what I do. He's the reason why I \nwill continue to look to do what I do for many,   many years to come. And when the guy that inspires \nyou actually comments on your own Instagram post   and leaves yet another inspiring message. He's \nalways going to get a 10 in my book when it   comes to that important X factor. \nAnd so now with all the rankings in,   it's time to break out the final totals to \nreveal my number one training partner choice,   as if it's not already obvious. With every list \nthough, guys, we have to start somewhere at the   bottom for me, Chuck Norris is going to get that \nbottom spot with a total score of 27. Next up,   we know Dolph Lundgren is somebody that I want \nto train with, Florian let s make it happen,   but I'm going to have to give him a score of \n32.5 for his total. Next up again, Van Damme is   going to be the popular choice for a lot of people \nout there make sure you leave your choice below.   But for me, he gets a total score of 34. \nNext up, this might be a surprise to some,   but again, maybe I'm partial to the Rocky \nSeries. But Carl Weathers is going to get   that next important ranking for me with a total \nof 35. Which leaves the two big guys at the top.   And of course, Arnold's going to get that second \nrunner up spot for me with a solid score of 37.5,   probably just falling short in terms of the \nreliability and the fact that I knew I can   never look like this a day in my life. But of \ncourse, for me, as it will always be, Sylvester   Stallone s at the top of the list and a solid \nscore here, an almost perfect score of 39.5. \n  And so now with that, I turn the decision over to \nyou. Who's your choice? Who of these six are you   picking? If you want to leave your entire list in \nthe order of who you'd like to train with, please   do so. Remember to thank your training partner \ntoo for skipping today's workout because again,   he probably gave you a hell of \na better training partner. \n  If you guys are looking for a complete training \nprogram, we have them all laid out for you over   at Atleanx.com.
