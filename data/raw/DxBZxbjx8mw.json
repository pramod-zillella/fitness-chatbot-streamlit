    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we are talking about a home chest workout that even the hardest of hard gainers can do so to see athleanx.com oh I got my intro within our world look you got Jesse at athleanx.com that's enough of a promotion okay do it it's Jesse in here at all this me in there god this is untouched fact is guys we're gonna do a home workout here today and as hard to gain there's no it's hard enough to try to build muscle the home environment definitely presents its own challenges but not anymore today we're going to tackle that chest workout and I'm gonna show you that it's about the exercises that you picked but more importantly I think it's about how you structure the exercises right and how you perform them so I have a really easy structure that you're gonna be able to follow no matter where you're at right now beginner to more advanced that you're gonna be able to build with and continue to build with over time as well and again no equipment at all you're gonna be able do this right in your own home I just worked out it's really simple all you need to do is know the alphabet oh boy not backwards when you're walking on a line just feel difficult listen for everybody else out there ABCDE right it goes through we're actually only dealing with a through E and what that represents as you can see here is five different exercises with a being the easiest version here of a push-up in E being the most difficult version of a push-up so the ones that we selected here are as follow starting at the easiest we have the incline rotating pushup okay then we move up to B which is slightly more difficult it's a hand release pushup we move to C which is the bear pushup I'll discuss what this is let me go to the decline wall push-up in the D spot and then for this particular workout the most difficult here is the one arm posted pushup so what your task is is to choose the one that is most challenging for you that only allows you to get maybe three to eight repetitions and if it's for the one arm posted pushup we're talking about three to eight per arm now let's say the decline wall push-up is where you start you start the decline wall pushup and you do four sets of this exercise here to failure in between each of the four sets you're gonna do this isometric control action here of the chest in its most shortened position with the arms abducted across your chest and you're actually trying to squeeze this as hard as you possibly can okay really trying to get a good contraction after you're done with that you're gonna rest and then you go perform the next set of that exercises until you've done all four of those and this point now you still got some work to do you take the next three letters moving back towards the front of the alphabet you do them in one consecutive drop set so in this case you were doing four sets of D now you're gonna be doing C be in a in a drop set fashion you go till failure you go again till failure and you go again till failure so in Jesse's case here you can see that he would do the bear pushup the fact that you're actually pushing up against the wall takes away some of the force of your feet down through the ground making it more challenging for your body to lift weight Jeff can't give them a tip real quick go ahead and take your shoes off if you don't have enough grip against the wall I found that barefoot was a lot easier to keep my feet post it up against the wall good yeah exactly so now write to failure and you mmediately go into this case they hand release push up yeah better than hand release push up is you actually get reinforcement that you're getting your chest all the way down to the ground because by letting your hands up off the ground you know your chest has touched it you get a little bit of additional benefit from some rotator cuff work as the external rotation of your arms to lift them and it does become fairly challenging as you start to rack up reps here but you do these until failure and then you go right into the last version here in this case it's the incline rotating push up the incline of course allowing your body a little bit less of the force of gravity downward upon it so it makes it a little bit easier for you to perform but the rotational aspect of it here is going to get a little bit more of that relative adduction to get a better contraction of the chest at the top so what if you were able to do the hardest exercise like the one arm posted here which by the way it's very similar in action to what's happening with that bear push-up without the ability of the toes to push down on the ground we know how much more difficult that exercise became well when you take one hand out of the equation you prevent it from pushing down into the ground and now one is pushing laterally you don't get all that assistance so you have to work extra hard to push to the other hand believe me it's tough so but let's say you could do it three to eight reps here that's where you would start ok and then you would go down into the d c b so your combination would be the decline wall pushup down to the bare push-up and then down the hand release as the final portion of that and remember this the part about this as cool is this will always scale with you let's say you couldn't do a minimum of three reps of either of those exercises the one arm posted or the decline wall but you could squeeze out three bear push-ups well then that will become the exercise that you start with and then you drop down to the hand release and then the incline rotation and then we have this subway exercise which is a squeeze push-up done from the knees so there's only something you can do and on the other hand if you for some reason could master more than three to eight reps with the one-arm postive pushup just take it a step up go to the one-arm push-up here like this this now becomes an F and then you work backwards through the e D in C yeah and if you can do F do a G there's a lot of things you can do you can continue to add a more difficult version or more explosive version of a push-up and you work yourself back but to do the four sets of that first exercise and then you work backwards into that three exercise combo in fact these guys it's a very simple structure but it's the structure that matters when you know how to put this together and you realize that for hardgainers the best option you have is to ensure that you're training to and through failure when you're at home the tendency is not to train hard enough we don't have the benefit of a real heavy benchpress to create that overloaded tension what we need to do here is we need to create more of a metabolic overload this is the way to do it you take it to and through failure and you utilize this mechanical drop set that allows you to keep going even we think you're fatigued because the exercise gets easier as you drop down right give it a try guys I promise you it's going to work if you're looking for a complete workout that's going to build your whole body and not just your chest without any equipment at all
