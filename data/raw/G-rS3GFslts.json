    "transcript": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nToday we continue our popular training with Band   Series, this time how to build bigger biceps when \nall you've got is bands. Guys that actually don't   have to compromise the results of your training if \nyou know how to do it. When it comes to any type   of bicep training, yeah, you're going be doing a \nlot of curls, but when you trained, particularly   with bands and you're doing a lot of curls, \nyou need to know how to utilize those bands and   specific ways to get the most of the exercises. \nI'm going to show you how to do exactly that,   guys. Ten exercises to get you on the right track \nto building bigger biceps with just bands.\n  So, I mentioned a whole bunch of curl variations, \nbut I actually don't want to start there. I   actually want to start right here up to the chin \nup bar. Because for me, one of the foundational   exercises for building bigger biceps is going to \nbe utilizing chin ups in some way, shape or form.   And the band comes in to actually make that job \nof yours even easier or harder, depending upon the   level that you're at right now. So, if you look at \nthe movement here, you can obviously see that the   supination of the form, the flexion of the elbow \nand the flexion of the shoulder puts the bicep   in a fully contracted position as a body weight \nexercise. Now, for some, body weight might be   a lot. So, the band could be stepped into and used \nas an assistance tool to make it easier as you   build up your strength and movement. Of course, \nI can make it more difficult, too, because I can   anchor the band to something sturdy and heavy on \nthe ground, put it around the back of my head,   and then jump up to that bar and bang out some \nchips and a much heavier, more overloaded fashion.   Either way, guys, you can't get around the fact \nthat the chin up is one of the basic foundational   moves for building bigger biceps and the \nbands make your job that much easier. \n  And that brings us now to the curling portion of \nour video. I told you, there's a lot of curls,   but remember, I also told you how you do the \ncurls matters. Because we know anatomically   the biceps have two heads. We have the inside \nshort head that you see when I do this. And we   have the outside long head that you see from \nthe side, more of the peak. And depending upon   the exercises that you choose, you can influence \nmore activity in the short or long head. We start   here with the No Money Curl. This is a short head \nexercise. Reason being, if you can view the inside   portion of my bicep when I do it, then that is \nthe portion of the biceps that you're actually   going to be working more and with No Money Curl \nI'm not just getting the resisted flexion and   supination that I get on a typical curl, but I \nalso have resisted external rotation that gives   you that little extra additional benefit to your \nrotator cuff, which is never a bad thing. \n  So now that being said, how do we target \nexercises that get the outer head or the   long head of the biceps? Well, we need to be able \nto see them when we perform the exercise and one   of the best ways to do that is with a more narrow \ngrip, pulling the band up a little bit tighter.   And this is where this exercise falls and hits the \nClose Grip Supination Curl. Now, remember I told   you that how you anchor the band matters? Well, \nthis is a particular instance where it actually   matters very much, because what I want to do is \nmake sure that I'm resisting supination and not   just flexion of the elbow. So, as I wrap the \nband, the way I'm showing you here, you'll see   the final wrap goes around that middle knuckle of \nthe finger. And that actually matters because as   I pull the band up and turn my wrist, I'm actually \nresisting supination with every single centimeter   that I move into supination. That means a better \ncontraction on the biceps, more work being done.   Now, the narrow position of the hands being \ndone really close together is going to reveal   that outer portion of the biceps more to the \nperson watching this, which in this case is you,   and that means the long head is preferentially \ngoing to get more of the activity. \n  Let's stick with that long head now for a second, \nbecause there's another way we can actually   influence the activation of that head of the \nbiceps. And that is by placing a stretch on it   before every single repetition. She might \nbe asking yourself, well, how do I do that?   Well, anatomically, with the tendon of the \nlong head attaching higher up on the shoulder   and it crossing the shoulder joint, we can place \nit preferentially into a stretched position   by getting our arm back behind our body into \nshoulder extension. So, if we set ourselves up   for something like this, a bicep stretch curl, we \nare getting a better stretch on the long head here   and by contracting I have a pre-stretched \nposition, we can get better activation.   Again, another option that's easy to set up just \nby simply anchoring it to something behind you,   but showcasing once again how you do the \ncurls you do in the ones that you select   will play a big part and the results that \nyou ultimately see from the exercises. \n  Because, of course, you just can't get enough \nof the long head--wait--And because long head   exercises are that beneficial, we need to make \nsure we have another option. And this is one   of my favorites. It's actually the Drag Curl, a \nfavorite of Vince Gironda. What you're doing is,   again, trying to reinforce the fact that you can \nget that arm back into extension behind your body,   you're going to get a different recruitment of \nthe biceps more favorably, hitting the fibers   of the long head. We do this by anchoring the bend \nunder our heels behind our body and then wrapping   it around our low back to stabilize it and keep it \nin place. At this point, all we're going to do is   lift our hands straight up to the ceiling, making \nsure to keep the elbows as far back as possible.   Look, there's a reason why this has become a \nlegendary exercise and why it's stuck around   for as long as it has, because it can produce \nlegendary games, if you remember to include it.\n  So, one of the nice advantages that comes from \ntraining with bands is that they offer up a   different strength curve that you would normally \nsee on a traditional curl. As you continue,   stretch this band out further and further and \nfurther, the resistance level goes up. So,   if we could find a way to match up that peak \ntension with the peak contraction of the biceps,   then we really have an exercise to hold onto \nand that's what we get here at the Lip Buster.   And by getting in this position, you can see that \nI have flexion of the elbow supination here of   the forearm, and I've got that elevated shoulder \ninto flexion that really creates that peak bicep   contraction. And of course, if I want to make \nit even more difficult and add an eccentric   component to this for more overload, all I have \nto do is perform a curl, take a giant step back   that will increase that tension even more and try \nto pull me back towards the bar. This is a must   have exercise when it comes to rounding out these \nten great choices for banded bicep exercises. \n  Speaking of feeling a strong biceps contraction, \nthere's no way I'm getting around a variation of   some sort of the Bicep Weighted Curl. Because \nwith the dumbbell, this is one of my favorite   ways to get that contraction in the biceps. But \nwe can still do the same thing with bands as long   as we are a little bit creative and we know once \nagain how to wrap the bands in the first place   to create a line of resistance we're looking for. \nSo, you can see I step into the band this way and   by positioning it around my hands now I'm getting \nall the overload right there through the distal   fingers and now all my job is to simply raise my \nhands, palms up the entire time straight towards   the ceiling. This mimics once again what we're \ntrying to accomplish here when we have a dumbbell   in our hands and we don't have to compromise \nor get rid of the exercise in the process. \n  So, one of the best parts about the Preacher Curl \nis that it actually, again, goes back to working   that inside short head of the biceps. And it does \nthat by positioning your arm out in front of your   body as opposed to keeping it back behind the \nbody like we talked about. The other thing is by   locking it in place, we eliminate a lot of the \nswing and momentum we use that would otherwise   cheat the exercise and take away some of its \nbenefits. We could do the same thing here with a   band by positioning ourselves like this. By taking \nthe stride stance and anchoring my elbow in place   on my knee, I can double up the band, so I have \nplenty of resistance out there to make sure it's   challenging me. But I can replicate all the \ngood benefits of a Preacher Curl, without   ever needing a bench, a dumbbell or anything \nother than the band I'm holding in my hand.\n  Now no list of \"bicep\" exercises would be complete \nwithout considering the brachialis. Yes, it's a   different muscle, but functionally it's going \nto have a lot of overlap with what the biceps   do and esthetically it's going to have an impact \non how yours looks. So, we want to do is work on   the muscle that lies underneath the biceps and the \nbest way to do this is two exercises. Number one,   we have the Crossbody Hammer Curl. So, I set \nthe band up nice and wide, so I have adequate   resistance here to challenge this muscle. But I \nalso want to pull the band up and across my body.   When I do this properly, I'm actually in \nthis pronated position and we know if we   can remain pronated we're taking away some of \nthe function of the biceps as a supinator so   I can more effectively target the brachialis as \na simple elbow flexor. If you do this properly,   you're not going to feel that typical bicep \ncontraction, but something much deeper and   knowing anatomically with this muscle lies, you're \ngoing to know you're doing it right now. \n  There's one downside to the Crossbody Hammer \nCurl, is that the resistance level that you're   going to be able to use there might be lower \nthan you'd expect. But that doesn't mean you   can't put up with the appropriate exercise \nchoice and that's where the Hammer Curl comes   in. In a slightly more neutral position what we \nwant to focus on here is the ability to handle   more weight or load and in this case, we can \ndo that by doubling up the band. We give this   offset grip. that's important because the more \nslack we have picking out from under that foot,   the less resistance that's applied to the band \nand the less slack we have there, the higher   the resistance level. Just remember, this option \nis going to give you that chance to load up with   some extra resistance, so don't forget to \ntake advantage of that fact and do so.\n  And with that you've now got ten exercises with \nbands that you can use to build bigger biceps   without compromise. And talking about bands, \nguys, a lot of you asked me where we get ours.
