    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we're going to talk about how to build wider shoulders I'm gonna tell you right now it's a lot easier than you might have thought it is and it only requires that you're be willing to change up the load on the same exercise you see you can do a side lateral raise we know to target that middle head of the del which by the way as a quick aside anatomically when we're looking to build that width it isn't just the middle delt that contributes there we can see that the front delt actually provides some overlap here as does the rear delt so a complete shoulder program is going to be the best way to do this but if you want to focus your efforts here and get more bang for your buck that middle head is what you should be tackling the exercise we're talking about is a side lateral raise and I'm talking about doing it two ways a light and a head and of course the mechanics on the exercise are going to change but if you want to build maximum shoulder development you need to lift both light and heavy it's one of these situations where people think well Jeff is recommended light weights before it doesn't mean exclusively light and jeff has also recommended heavy weight training before but it's not exclusively heavy as a matter of fact whatever you're doing less of right now is probably where you should be varying more of your efforts but even then both of these should be part of your arsenal let me show you the differences in how you want to perform them though and why because that's where all the benefits come from if I do light my main focus should be and yours should be this muscle recruitment of the appropriate muscle and a metabolic overloading your training meaning really trying to build up higher repetitions more metabolic damage here in the shoulder and we could do that by first performing it like this the first move when we do this lateral raise is right here in the muscle we're trying to target we're trying to recruit the delt to do the work not allowing the traps to start shrugging your arm up to initiate the lift so it means lighter weights I've got 15 pounds here sometimes I use 10 and I'm trying to initiate right here as you can see right there in that mid del okay if I initiate there the rest of the course of the upward lift here is all going to be handled by that mid don't lie and I come back down slow I want to make sure all the effort is being focused and directed right here and again I come up I try to keep the tension on the delt as much as possible I'm not looking to rest or give it any time off as a matter of fact one of the techniques I've talked about is a one-and-a-half rep come down only half way go back up again there's no momentum at play here everything is under the control of the middle delt doing all the work with the idea of being to get to the point where it's burning and you keep going until you cannot tolerate the burn even a single second more that's a metabolic overload that's the purpose of that we go and we switch to the heavy dumbbells we have a couple other benefits here that can't be overlooked again if you want maximum shoulder development it needs to be part of your training this is a cheat lateral and the benefit here is twofold number one we have the opportunity to accelerate a heavy weight compensatory acceleration of heavier weights it's one of the best ways to recruit type 2 muscle fibers and any muscle you train when it comes to the shoulders they tend to respond very quickly in the form of more hypertrophy and growth the second benefit we get is a controlled eccentric on the way down which is something we don't often get with shoulder training because of the nature of the lifts that we do they don't really place a really eccentric stress on the mid dealt this exercise does so we load up with something substantially heavier this is 45 pounds three times that weight this we get into an athletic stance arm in front of our body here we're gonna load up accelerate the weight up under control still when we get to the top try to freeze it and then each centrically control on the way down it's still going to come down in a quick pace but we're eccentric we fighting that so it's here up and down up Oh every time I'm trying to accelerate up and down one more okay another option you have going even lighter right after that take advantage of that metabolic buildup and then just try to control a few really nice slow control rest at the end of that the idea is guys complete shoulder development complete muscular development really have any muscle requires a mix of both heavier and lighter weights the interesting thing here is the same exercise there's gonna be incredibly effective at hitting this area you're trying to grow and widen but varying the load has to substantially different impacts and results you need to figure out how to do both as I said in the beginning whatever you're doing less of right now is what you should be very more of your focus towards guys I hope you found the video helpful if you haven't already make sure you try this if you haven't done so guys make sure you leave a comment let me know what else you want me to cover what other things can I try to help you with with these videos I'll do my best to do that for you if you have already done so could subscribe and turn your notifications so you never miss a new video when we put one out and if you're looking for programs where nothing gets overlooked heavy-light eccentric metabolic all the stimuli for growth we build them into all of our programs they're all available over at athleanx.com step-by-step way all right guys be back here again in just a couple days see ya [Music] you"
