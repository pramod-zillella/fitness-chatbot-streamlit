    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today I'm going to tell you what the worst exercise is when it comes to causing hernias in the gym and more importantly I'm going to tell you what you could do to fix that exercise now here's the thing I don't care if you've never had a hernia before if you are a man you need to be concerned about this because one in four men are going to suffer a hernia at some point in their life so that means you probably know at least a couple guys even if you haven't had one yourself and you might want to share this with them to help them out but the thing is people think I know what it is do you have anything when you get in the gym you got a load up a lot of weight like let's say a deadlift come on the bar here come down and that's not the cause of the hernia guys as a matter of fact it's not necessarily the weight that you're lifting that's causing the hernia it's more the position of your body when you're doing the exercise and for me by far the exercise that takes the cake for causing hernias uses just a single dumbbell in this bench and it's the one-armed dumbbell row now guys I love the one on a dumbbell row I program the one on a dumbbell row I've done videos on the one on a dumbbell row I've shown you how to correct some of the other issues that come along with the one on dumbbell row in terms of the hunching of the back and not using proper form to actually use the lats to get the dumbbell up through and past into extension past your body but here's the problem our own Anatomy a lot of times betrays us and sets this up as the exercise that causes the problem and I've actually felt the repercussions of this exercise twice I've had two hernias literally doing this exercise alone and the thing again to show you how much I liked it even after the first time I figured it was a fluke I kept doing it the way I was doing it and I actually suffered a second hernia a couple years ago the straw that broke the camel's back for me was woman I just had a high performing athlete come in here and we were actually working on trying to re-establish balance through his pelvis and up through his groin because of the repercussions of having a hernia from guess what as we did our history doing this exercise he felt that common zipper like burn that goes up here through the groin here's why so when we do this exercise we grab one weight and again yes the heavy you're going to go here the more likely you're going to have an issue the fact is though you can still do it with a lighter weight but we get into position like this we drop one leg on the outside one knees up on the bench one hand is here now again we've corrected the issues of having our background in and all that but what I'm talking about when it comes to the hernia is the position that we just placed ourselves in in relation to our groin so with this leg out to the side I don't really have that much weight through this leg but I have just enough and I have a lot of my weight in through this leg that's up on the bench and now as I go to pull I'm asymmetrically loaded here on my in my pelvis okay so the pelvis still is going to be impacted by the fact that one foot is on the ground and this is up here again bearing weight through the femur on the bench the pelvis is still impacted meaning all that muscles that attach to it including the abdominal muscles here are going to be impacted because of this asymmetrical load here and the pre-stretched position of my leg out to the side I am now in a big position that especially with a heavier weight as I come down there's even a little bit of a squat here that's going to load this and stretch this out even a little bit more I talked about the anatomy guys when we're developing has children our testicles drop down into position and they drop through the inguinal canal a lot of times that England canal is not closed off you're causing an area for compromise or an area of weakness and the abdominal muscles down here secondly the spermatic cord that runs down here and feeds into your testicles literally goes through and exits through a hole through your abdominal muscles that is already weakening this structure women don't have nearly as many hernias in england hernias because they don't have that element there they don't have that pre weakness already compromising the abdominal muscles so you have that so by fact that you have a hole already in place even if your muscles are very strong as a matter of fact I would argue the stronger they are the more likely you are going to incur a hernia because you have a lot of tension in here that's pulling on an area that already has a hole that leads to the herniation right here in your lower abdominal region and causes that inguinal hernia which is that notable bump or a lump because what you're seeing is the intestines are actually sticking through that hole and pushing up against your skin and you can see that little lump and bump here so here's how you fix it guys because we can't really continue to do that and I'm recommending that we make a change can I've done a lot of one-arm rows I think there's a much better way to do this and we won't compromise any effectiveness of the exercises itself and all you have to do is straddle the bench so instead of setting yourself up that way you straddle the bench this way you don't have to get nearly as wide so when you're in this position here now you can Center your hand on your chest right here like this you can be in this more athletic position with both feet on the ground you don't need to get so far out to the side again you don't need to have a wide stance out there with my legs so far out as I was or even back as I am now I'm pretty symmetrical and from here I get my head up I get my ass up my back arched my shoulders drop chest out pull up two three four and again we're not in the over-rotate to try to cheat this dumbbell off if you can't lift this thing up into extension elbow back behind your body then you probably use into a heavier weight anyway okay soon as we're done right on the bench slides over the other side and we go we knock out the other side but this is a much better position again not compromising the effectiveness of the exercise at all for your lats and your back but putting symmetrical loading through your legs into your pelvis that takes away in the likelihood that you're going to incur some sort of herniation by doing this exercise guys like I said from experience I've experienced it twice it's no fun it literally feels like a burning zipper right up here and then you got we're going to determine whether or not you're gonna do surgery or try to go through it until you can't go through it anymore so guys I hope you found this video helpful in the meantime if you're looking for a science-based training program where the anatomy plays into it how you perform your exercises
