That's right, I'm going to show you how to\nuse a barbell today to train your abs. So without further ado, let's get right to\nthis thing. This is one bad boy that you're going to want\nto start incorporating into your ab training. So there you have it, guys. 300 reps. It doesn't matter what ability you are at.
