    "transcript": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nYou asked for it and I'm bringing it,   the perfect push workout out, complementing \nour perfect pull and legs work outs in our   PPL series. Guys, look, I understand that perfect \nis subjective right, in the eye of the beholder.   I mean, even Jesse's been called perfect, \nbut then again, that was his mother. \n  When we look at creating a perfect workout, \nno matter what it is, you have to understand   there's a lot of selection's that go into that. \nI'm making my bold selections here and putting   them into this workout for a reason because I \nbelieve it's going to work to help you to build   muscle. That being said guys, I want to break it \ndown for you step-by-step and show you not just   what we're picking, but why we're picking it so \nyou can get the gains that you're looking for. \n  Okay, so now a quick refresher for those that \nare unfamiliar with the PPL split, it's Push,   Pull and Legs. On the Push that you're training \nyour pushing muscles generally your triceps,   shoulders and chest. And on Pull day, you're \ntraining your biceps and back, noting that there   are a lot of back muscles and we're accounting \nfor those in that workout. And, of course,   you have your legs on a specific day as well. And \nthe way we're going to actually break this down in   this PPL split is by starting with a Pull workout, \nfollow it with a Push workout, which is what we're   going to show today and then go into our legs.\nNow, after that, you have two options. You can   either repeat this cycle for six straight \ndays of training before taking a day off and   then repeating it all over again. Or you can do \nwhat we do here, which is take these three days   and then put a rest day in between \nand you start these three days again,   followed by another rest. This is called \nthat, asynchronous split. And you're getting   more frequent rest days in between these workouts, \nwhich allows for more recovery. But it also on the   offside here is, is creating an unpredictable off \nday. Some people don't like that, but I do believe   that the benefits of getting that extra \noff day are going to serve you well. \n  Which brings us now to our workouts and the \nexercise. And that's why I said workouts,   because in the perfect pitch workout here, we \nactually have two of them Push One and Push Two.   And the reason for that is we're going to select \nexercises that actually help to complement each   other from Push One to Two, but also help to stand \nalone with their own benefits. And I believe when   we're trying to accomplish something as big as \ncreating muscle growth with this split, we need   to have more options at our disposal. We're going \nto break them down into two parts. Part One here   starts with our classic push exercise here from \nactually building strength as one of our main   mechanisms of driving growth through overload \nand this is the Barbell Bench Press. And we're   going to perform this as four sets of four to six. \nWe're going to leave one or two reps in the tank,   though not taking all the way to failure. \nHowever, it is important that as you start to   fatigue, that you may have to adjust the weights \naccordingly to allow you to continue to fall   within this four to six reps range. The next \nexercise, however, is one specifically designed   to complement that one and then say Hi-to-Low \nCrossover. And the reason why I like the crossover   and I've talked about this in many videos before, \nis it gives me the chance to do what the Barbell   Bench Press doesn't, and that is to get the chest \ninto a completely contracted state by getting the   arm fully adducted across the body. Now, when we \ntake the angle from high to low, we're allowing   ourselves to follow the fibers to hit more of the \nlower chest, the abdominal fibers here. But most   importantly, it gives us the opportunity to get \nthat full adduction of the hand across the chest.   Good hypertrophy exercise. Good spot here at \nthe number two spot, three sets of 10 to 12. \n  And now we're going to shift the focus a little \nbit to the shoulders. And here I'm going to go   with the Dumbbell Shoulder Press. Now, I have \nthe opportunity here to try to do an overhead   press with the barbell, but I believe that is \nbetter served as a strength building exercise   that's going to get its own day, hence Push Two. \nNow I'm doing the standing version here rather   than the seated version. And if you watch my Iron \nFace-Off video, you would understand why. When you   sit down, I don't like the restrictions that come \nfrom pushing your scapula back into the bench,   which can disrupt normal shoulder mechanics. \nNot to mention if I can get you on your feet, I   always like to take that opportunity. You perform \nthat for four sets of 8 to 10, slightly higher   up range, again, reserving the lower ranges for \nstrength base progression in that second day. \n  We then move on to that second exercise, \nfollowing up very much the same way we did   with the crossover. And this is the 1 1/2 Side \nLateral Raise. Again, trying now to focus a little   bit more for hypertrophy on that middle Delt. And \nwe could do it with this one and a half rep style   that increases the time that we're under tension \nin the exercise. So, we take it up fully all the   way, we come down halfway and then we have to \ngo back up to the top again. Eliminating all   momentum from the movement and again, forcing the \nmuscle we're actually trying to get to grow to do   the work. We perform this one in three sets at \na higher rep range of 12 to 15. Again, really   focusing on good quality contractions, not muscle \nsubstitution that often happens with the traps and   simply just momentum swinging the weight up.\nAnd then we come back, and we move to the direct   tricep portion of the workout, understand \nthe triceps we've been working through all   the other exercises we've been doing so far. \nBut in this case, we're going to go directly   at them. And we're going to actually pair \nthem up with, get this, a pulling exercise,   a bicep exercise here on push day. Why? Because \nwe have an opportunity when we pair this in   the entire PPL split we put together here to get \nsome additional volume for the biceps on push day   without interfering with what we're trying to \naccomplish here and our pushing exercises. And   that is we start with a big push exercise for the \ntriceps, my favorite, the Lying Tricep Extension,   this is going to perform for three sets of 10 to \n12 to failure, and they're going to go right into   the Dumbbell Waiter's Curl. And these are both \ngood exercise selections here. Number one, the   tricep exercises hitting the long head primarily \nby getting that good, stretch in the bottom   position, we're able to do something we haven't \nnecessarily done through the other exercises.   When we push overhead or push out in front, the \nmedial lateral head tend to get most of the work,   the long head here is going to get some extra \nspecial attention through the first exercise.   Again, the Dumbbell Waiter's Curl is also a long, \nhard exercise, but this time for the biceps,   serving again is the perfect complement and giving \nus a chance to get some additional volume. Three   sets of 10 to 12 on both ends of the superset.\nAnd before we call it a day here, guys, no   Athleane-X workout is complete without making sure \nwe pay a little bit of attention to bulletproofing   our body to the use of some correctives, and by \ncorrective of choice here it's a Rotator Cuff   External Rotation. Guys, simply grab a band and \nperform this boring but all-important exercise to   finish out this workout, three sets of 15 to 20. \nWhen you do a push and workout, you're internally   rotating a lot. The muscles on the front side \nof the body tend around the shoulders and pull   them into internal rotation, simply doing some \nadditional direct external rotation here is the   perfect way to finish this first push workout. \nAnd that brings us to push workout number two. And   as I said before, not just for the sake of doing \nanother workout, but meant to complement what   we either did or did not do in the first push \nworkout. There are certain things I still want   to accomplish here, and it starts right off the \nbat with a heavier focus, Overhead Barbell Press.   And again, we to do this the same way we did \nthe bench press with four sets of four to six,   leaving one to two in the tank, making sure to \nadjust the weights accordingly to make sure you   stay in that rep range on all four sets. Again, \nserving as the compound lift here meant for giving   us an opportunity to increase our strength to \ndrive hypertrophied through that mechanism.\n  We follow that up by shifting our focus away from \nthe shoulders now to the chest again. And this   time with a variation of a bench press, the same \none that we brought the Dumbbell Overhead Press in   in lieu of the Overhead Barbell Press. Now \nwe're going to bring a Dumbbell Press in   and lower the Barbell Bench Press and this \ntime to do the Dumbbell Underhand Bench Press.   I love this exercise because it allows us to \nactually work the upper chest even though we're in   a flat bench position and it saves our shoulders \nand front delts specifically from the overload   that would come if we were trying to do this \nas a regular Incline Dumbbell Bench Press. So,   we get the benefits of upper chest training \nwithout having to put ourselves in a position   mechanically that might overtax your shoulders. \nNow, with a brief reprieve of the shoulder work,   we're now able to go back to it directly. In this \ncase, just like we did in the first push workout,   we're going to try to hit the middle delt more \nspecifically. As a matter of fact, we're also   going get the benefit of getting the rear delt \ninvolved here. But we're going to do it by driving   with a posterior chain pull dominant movement. \nThat's right a pull-down movement push day. And   the reason we do this is for that exact reason, \nif there's any fatigue that has accumulated   to this point, you're going to have a chance \nto offset that by pulling rather than pushing   more and still working the same muscles.\nThe abduction row is simply getting that shoulder   into the necessary abduction to hit the middle \nin the rear delt this time. But we don't have to   drive that through a lot of the typical pushing \nmovements, especially like a Side Lateral Raise.   So, we lean forward and drive into abduction by \nrowing the arm back and out, making sure to keep   extra rotation at the shoulder. But you'll see \nand feel that this will light up the middle and   rear delts very effectively allowing you to train \nit even heavier as well, in the 8 to 10 range,   while still allow you enough energy to continue \nto attack the rest of this push workout. \n  Which brings us to our fourth exercise here, \nback to the chest is the Dumbbell Floor Fly. Now,   you guys know how I feel about the unsupported \nversion of this done on a bench, I feel like   it compromises the health of your shoulder \nand increases the risk where we don't need   to. If we simply do this down on the floor, \nwe get two additional benefits. Number one,   we have the safety net of the floor to make sure \nthat we're not over stretching the capsule of   anterior shoulder. And secondly, we have the \nopportunity to go a little bit heavier because   we can take these up and we can even cheat them up \nto the top if we have to and lower them down.\n  What we're really focused on here is getting \nthat eccentric overload, which we know is   another driver of hypertrophy. We perform these \nfor three sets of 10 to 12. Which brings us to   the direct tricep portion of the workout, which \nis going to once again be superseded with some   additional bicep work for volume. But this time \nwe're going to go a little bit heavier. We're   going with the tricep Close Grip Bench Press \nperforming three sets of six to eight reps to   add a strength based movement that is more tricep \nfocused to create additional games. We select this   exercise as a complement to the tricep extensions \nwe did, which was focused more on the long head.   Here, once again, now we're using some additional \nweight to focus on the medial lateral heads. And   the exercise we're going to pair that up with this \ntime is simply a dumbbell curl of choice and I   mean that. After all, curls are essentially curls, \nno matter how you perform them. The fact is you   choose one of them, perform them for three sets of \n10 to 12, slightly higher up rep range, pair them   up as a superset and you're off and running. \nAnd that brings us to that final spot once again.   And I have an interesting selection here to end \nthe second workout. I want to work on some scapula   control and some scapula strengthening, but I \nstill want to get a little bit additional volume   here for the chest and this is going to be with \nthe Pushup Plus. And the idea here is you simply   go into the top of a push up, but then you push \nall the way through as hard as you can, allowing   your shoulder blades to wrap around your body into \nprotraction. This is going to train the Serratus   and give them some stability that they oftentimes \ndon't get unless you intentionally try to train   for it. You're going to go three sets to failure \nhere, I'm not so concerned about what that number   is, as much as I'm concerned that you're nailing \nthe mechanics on this every single time. \n  And then you have guys, the perfect push work out, \nbroken down into both parts, part one and two,   both of them here for you to view and make sure \nyou take your screen shot so you could take them   with you to the gym and make sure you get this \nright. Guys, remember, it's not just the exercises   you pick, but why you're doing what you're doing \nthat gets you the results. If you're looking for a   step-by-step programs guys, we have done that all \nfor you already there over at Athleanx.com. \n  If you like this series, if you like the perfect \nworkouts, make sure you leave a comment below,   tell me what else you want going to cover, \nI'll do my best to do that for you.
