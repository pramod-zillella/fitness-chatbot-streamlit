    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Hey, I'm not lying. I'm literally going to show you today how\nto get abs while sitting on your ass. But don't get too comfortable because when\nyou're down there you're going to work. Every single one of these exercises today\nis going to be done from the sitting position, down on the floor. Guess what? We're going to hit all those key components,\nthose ab movements that I always talk about that you need to hit. Bottom up rotation, top down rotation, mid-range,\nobliques; we're going to hit them all. All from this one position, just by changing\nthe orientation of our body. All right, you guys ready? Let's do this. So there you have it, guys. Another ab workout to add to the arsenal. Again, those one, great because there's no\nexcuses. If you can get that ass of yours from the\ncouch to the floor we've got something cooking here. All I want you to do though is start. Remember, that's the thing that stops most\npeople. That's getting started. If you're looking for me to coach you through\nevery single workout I'm happy to do it. Head over to ATHLEANX.com to get our AHLTENAX\ntraining system. In the meantime, if you've found this video\nhelpful make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below and tell me what else\nyou want me to cover on Washboard Wednesday and I'll do my best to do that. All right, guys. I'll see you again real soon."
