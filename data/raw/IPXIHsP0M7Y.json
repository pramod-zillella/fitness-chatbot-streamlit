    "transcript": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nSo, someone do calisthenics exercises, because   let's face it, we're forced to. We either \ndon't have access to a gym or our home gym   environment just isn't really the best. Well, I \ndon't care if you have access to an entire gym,   the 10 exercises that I'm going to show you \nhere today are ones that everyone should do.   Let's start breaking them down one by one. \nSo it should come as no surprise that any list   of must do calisthenics exercises is going to \nstart up here at the bar and of course, with   the classic pullup. Because this king of all upper \nbody bodyweight exercises is there for a reason,   because it works. And again, to underscore the \npoint of this video, even if you had access to a   full gym and can use a barbell for deadlifts or \nrows or could use even a lat pulldown machine,   you're still going to want to do pullups. Because \nthe unique benefits of commanding your body in   space in a vertical pulling environment \nis going to make this one worthy of being   included in any back workout that you do. \nWe're not done just yet, because when it comes   to training your biceps, being up at the \nbar here is one of the best places to be   yet again. You see what you do the chinup \nby just simply changing the grip here to   an underhand position. You're going to work the \nbiceps very effectively. Now one thing you want   to do is make sure you're not pulling straight \nup and down with your body close to the bar.   Introducing some of that distance away from the \nbar is what's going to create the almost curling   effect of your body up to the bar. Remember, a \nbarbell curl curls the bar up to you, a chinup   curls your body up to the bar. And speaking of \nthe barbell curl, yes, you're still going to be   doing those, but not at the exclusion of doing the \nchinup. Remember, guys, the calisthenics exercises   that I'm covering here today are non-negotiable, \nregardless of what access to a gym you have. \n  And since we're on a roll now with the basics, \nlet's keep it going now down here on the floor   with a pushup. You see, I talked about before \nfinding the appropriate pushup for you, because if   you're doing just a lot of reps of a basic pushup, \nthen no, this exercise isn't one of my favorite.   But if you're finding the variation that \nchallenges you, then this exercise becomes one   that must be included in your pushup workouts. \nAnd the benefits here are many. Not only is it   a closed chain pushing exercise that's unlike the \nbench press and dumbbell bench press, but it also   provides you with that safe opportunity to push \nyourself to your all-out max. To go to failure   without having to find, let's say, a safe resting \nspot for the dumbbells or a barbell resting spot   that preferably isn't on your chest. When \nwe can take our exercises to failure guys,   we can push ourselves to that next level \nto force new muscle growth. The pushup   s going to do that again in that close chain \nenvironment, and it makes it an irreplaceable   part of any successful workout program.\nAnd that brings us to exercise number four,   which is a little bit more creative but no less \ncritical and we're talking about the Slick Floor   Bridge Curl because what we're doing is we're \ngiving ourselves an opportunity to train the   posterior chain in a way that we actually don't \nreally get a chance to do with some of the other   gym-based exercises. I mean, think about it, \nthe barbell hip thrust is good at training   hip extension, but it has no dynamic action at the \nknee, no flexion. At same time, we have Alliance   Hamstring Curl, which I'm not a fan of because of \nwhat it can do to the low back. But regardless,   it's got active knee flexion, but with no hip \nextension. What we get here is the opportunity   to combine hip extension and knee flexion so \nthat the hamstrings and glutes can work together   in the way that they actually prefer. That makes \nthis an exercise that isn't just a gimmick, but   one that's actually irreplaceable when it comes to \ngetting the most effective training and complete   program for hitting your posterior chain. \nThe next one is not one you're going to find at   the top of the best muscle building calisthenics \nexercises, but it's no less important, and it's   another one that's going to hit that posterior \nchain. We're talking about the Reverse Hyper,   and this would be categorized, yes, as more \nof a corrective exercise. But when you look   at it as capacity to actually unlock some bigger \ntotals on your bigger list, then you realize how   irreplaceable it really is. So regardless of the \nfact that it's just a body weight calisthenics   exercise, it still needs to be in every single \nperson's program. It's strengthening the glutes   and the low back. And again, like the hamstrings \nand glutes on a Slick Floor Bridge Curl,   getting them to work together. If you can \nincrease the strength of your hip extenders,   you're going to have an easier time driving the \nbar off your chest at the bottom of a bench press   and performing a properly executed deadlift. The \nfact is, this is simple to do and can be done   anywhere. You can do it on a bench, on a box or \neven your couch. Just make sure you do it. \n  For those that love action \nmovies more than love stories,   well, you're not going to like this next exercise \nbecause there's not a lot of action. But there's   definitely a lot of love when it comes to this \nexercise from me because of all the things that   it can do for you. We're talking about the Dead \nArm Hang. If you'll hang with me for a minute,   I'll explain why. You see this exercise is one \nthat allows us to test a lot of things, like I   said. Number one, your mental toughness. \nCan you hang from the bar, especially as that   pain starts to set into your forearms and hands \nthat's building our grip strength in the process?   But we not only get the benefits there, we get \nthe opportunity to work on shoulder stability.   The ability to maintain that packed shoulder \nposition throughout the hang is one that's going   to serve us well when we go into other \nexercises that apply attraction stress   like a barbell row or even a deadlift. \nOnce again, it's one of those exercises that's   hard to overlook because of how multifaceted it \nis. And even if you have access to, let's say,   dumbbells for carries, you're still going to want \nto work the Dead Arm Hang into your routine.\n  Hanging Ab Raises are still going to be \none of the best ways to train your abs,   and it doesn't have to necessarily be with \na straight leg. Look, I understand that any   hanging exercise for abs is going to be one of \nthe more difficult exercises for your abs because   you have to lift the weight of your legs. But as \nwith everything else, guys, with the difficulty   comes the reward. I've actually made a whole \nvideo dedicated to the importance of hanging ab   exercises when it comes to creating the \nbest looking and most well-developed abs,   you just have to make sure you pick one. Whether \nit's the legs straight or the knees bent, somehow   some way you need to still incorporate these into \nyour routine, regardless of what fancy ab exercise   machine you might have access to, or however many \nab exercises you're doing down on the floor.\n  And now Story Time with Jeff Cavalier. All right, \nso this next one will benefit from a bit of a back   story. My shoulders have always been one of my \nmore muscular or better defined muscle groups.   However, I can tell you that back in the day I \nwas doing this next exercise the Handstand Pushup   every single time I train them until I hurt my \nlabrums. At that point, I kind of shied away   from this to my detriment. You see, this is one \nof the best exercises you can do for a lot of   reasons. As a matter of fact, it's one of the best \nways to actually overcome a labrum issue because   of the beneficial compressive stresses that we get \nby doing some variation of a handstand press. \n  And while some will claim that you should put \nplates under your hands to do this exercise for   increase range of motion, that's actually not \nthe real driver of the benefits here. Again,   it's the compressive stress in the close chain \nenvironment that's leading to the coordinated   development of the delts, with the all-important, \noften neglected scapular stabilizer muscles that   makes this thing as good as it is. \nNow, it doesn't have to start this way,   you can always do a pike pushup, getting \nthe same close chain benefits that you   would in the pushup and again working your \nshoulders more favorably here. However,   I'm imploring you to add a few repetitions, at \nleast, of these the next time you train because   of the unique benefits they provide. That now \nconcludes Story Time with Jeff Cavaliere.\n  So, for exercise nine we re back at the bar \nagain, but this time not a pullup bar, this is   the Inverted Row. And we talk about the difference \nbetween horizontal pulling exercises and vertical   pulling exercises and how they work different \nmuscles more favorably. The lats and teres being   a little bit more worked with the vertical \npulling exercises and the round boys and mid   scapula muscles in the overall thickness in the \nback being a little bit more effectively targeted   with the horizontal pulling exercises. \nSo the Inverted Row gives us that option. And   even if we had access to a Barbell Row, you still \nwant to do this because it's an important element   here that is oftentimes missing from the row. \nYou see if you can attack the bar on a pulling   exercise with your sternum, you can get into more \neffective scapular retraction, and sometimes we   just let the bar take us for the ride on a regular \nrow. This is a great bodyweight compliment,   but just an all-around good complementary exercise \nand effectively designed pulling workout. This   is why you're not going to want to skip.\nNow regardless of whether you had access to   a decline bench and either a barbell or a full \nrack of dumbbells. I'm still going to want you   to do a Dip. Because not only is this one of the \nbetter upper body by the weight pushing exercises,   but it's fully capable of helping you to \ndrive lower chest development and also   triceps and shoulder development too, because \nit's simply a body weight beast when it comes   to pushing exercises. Now, it doesn't mean that it \ndoesn't come with some necessary precautions.\n  You want to make sure that you're limiting \nthe depth of the exercise to prevent   that over rounding of the shoulder in the \nbottom position. We also want to make sure   that we're keeping our shoulders down and back, \nas I pointed out in many videos. The fact is,   guys, if performed properly, the Bodyweight Dip \nis one of the better exercises for building your   upper body, and therefore it's going to need \na place in your workout program regardless   if you're doing so with weights or not. \nNow, if gym and equipment access is just simply   not an option for you right now and you're \nlooking for the best bodyweight exercises   for building muscle across your whole body, \nI put together a list of those as well. Guys,   you're going to want to watch that video if you're \nlooking for a complete program that requires no   equipment at all. We have our Athlean-Xero program \navailable at athleanx.com.
