    "transcript": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com. \nSo, when it comes to food choices,   I'm sure we all have our own preferences. \nHowever, today I'm going to show you five   foods you really need to make room for in \nyour diet. We all should be eating these,   not just because they're good, healthy \nchoices, but when it comes to the gym,   they're actually science proven to help \nyou build muscle faster. And the best part   is finding a way to incorporate them into \nwhat you're already eating is super simple.   Kind of simple. \nAll right, so,   it doesn't get any easier than \nthis first food to start reaping   the benefits both in the gym and just in \nyour overall health than the blueberry.   Now, look, we've got to get something straight \nright off the bat here. I'm not talking about   blueberry flavored anything or blueberries in it. \nSo, anybody that likes those blueberry scones from   Starbucks, that doesn't count. Well, what we're \ntalking about, though, is just eating pure,   fresh blueberries and that's going to be a theme \nthroughout the entire video. Now, when it comes   to blueberries, I also sometimes hear, Well, they \ncan make you fat there's a lot of sugar in them.   Guys, do me a favor, nobody ever got fat eating \nblueberries. There are 0.8 calories in each one of   these things. That means for 100 of them, you get \nabout 80 calories, which is only 15 grams of sugar   and it's also not very high in the glycemic index, \nso it doesn't cause those blood sugar spikes.\n  Now, when it comes to the gym, there \nis actually a study performed on women   aged 25 to 40 who ate two cups of blueberries for \nsix weeks. And what they found was an increase in   the number of human muscle progenitor cells, \nwhich are the cells that go on to produce   new muscle tissue. And they also saw a lower \npercentage of dead human muscle progenitor cells,   which indicated a resistance to oxidative stress. \nIn other words, more resilience as they went   through their own workouts. So, what that means is \nfaster muscle recovery in between workouts. And we   know that if you're going to train natural, \nfaster muscle recovery is your number one   weapon for building new muscle throwing. \nThrow in the fact that these are also rich   in vitamin C and potassium and are a powerful \nanti-inflammatory and you can't go wrong with   adding blueberries to your diet, especially \nbecause it's so damn easy to do. And so,   there isn't a single one of us out here who \nhasn't probably been told since the age of   two that we should be eating more green \nvegetables and for good reason. However,   there's a specific type of green vegetables I want \nyou to be focusing on, and they're the cruciferous   vegetables. And maybe the first thing that pops \ninto your mind is broccoli or cauliflower. But did   you know, there's actually a lot more choices that \nwill fit the bill here? We re talking about things   like cabbage or Brussels sprouts or bok choy or \nkale or one of my favorites, broccoli rabe.\n  All of these foods are rich in three important \nthings, the first being phytonutrients, the second   being vitamin K and the third being something \ncalled sulforaphane. You see these foods when   eaten or cooked or chopped, will actually break \ndown a substance called glucoraphanin and into   sulforaphane. Sulforaphane is actually being \nproven to be a very, very powerful antioxidant   and also anti-inflammatory. One of my favorites \nI always mention here on this channel, Rhonda   Patrick has talked a lot about these benefits. \nNow, maybe you're thinking to yourself,   but I don't really like any of those foods, \neven the other options you gave me, Jeff. Well,   you can still meet your needs by just having a \nsalad with some arugula and radish in it. So,   there's no excuses here, there are a lot of food \noptions. And when it comes to building muscle,   there's actually some exciting studies coming \nout that were done, albeit pig cells, and no,   we're not pigs, but we do have similar muscle \ncells. And they showed that by exposing these   human pig muscle cells to Sulforaphane, that \nthey could actually deactivate something called   myostatin. And that's a type of protein that's \nactually responsible for putting the brakes on new   muscle growth. So, if mom's urgings weren't enough \nof a reason to put more of these on your plate,   hopefully now with greater options here, you've \ngot greater reason to make sure you do. \n  Look, while green foods might get all the \nlove. You also have to pay attention to the   orange foods because there's plenty to love \nabout that. And no, Jesse, we're not talking   about these, they don't count. But what we \nare talking about is foods like cantaloupe,   pumpkin, squash, my favorite sweet potatoes, \ncarrots, mangos and even oranges themselves.   And they all have carotenoids, and these are \nactually protect our health. They're what are   known as free radical scavengers. They go out and \nthey get rid of the oxidation that can cause cell   breakdown in early aging. And they also help to \nprotect things even like your own eyesight. \n  The fact is, guys, you need to get more of \nthem in your diet. But how? Well, first of all,   unlike the blueberries, since there's a greater \nvariety here of these foods, they're not all   the same in terms of their calorie impact. So, \nsome a little bit more caloric like the sweet   potatoes or oranges and some a little bit on the \nlighter side, like cantaloupe and pumpkin. You've   just got to figure out where that fits in your \ndiet. But you need to figure out some way to fit   some version of them into it. And when it comes \nto the body changing capabilities of these foods,   they actually did a study on competitive \ncyclists where they looked at a particular   flavonoid inside of oranges called 2S-Hesperidin, \nand they did it over the course of eight weeks.   They had 40 amateur cyclists divided into \ntwo groups, one that took it, 500 milligrams,   and the other one that did not. \nAnd they saw something pretty impressive   findings. The supplemental group showed a decrease \nin body fat percentage by 10.4%. Now, mind you,   that's not, let's say, from 20% down to 10%. \nThat's a 10% drop from, let's say, 20. So 2%   loss in body fat, but it's still significant. \nThey also found an increase in muscle mass,   percentage of 1% and total muscle mass of \n1.7% with no changes in the placebo. And   the good news is you don't have to be an athlete \nto see these benefits. The fact is you just need   to figure out a way to start eating more of these \norange foods. One little caution here, though. \n  If you eat too much of this, you can get \nsomething called carotenemia, which is when   you actually start to get like orange-colored \nhands. And I kind of mentioned how much I love   sweet potatoes and pumpkin. It's actually due to \nan increase in vitamin A. And if you see that,   all you have to do is just simply decrease \nyour consumption. But I'll tell you this,   most people are not having a problem with too \nmuch of this, they're having too little. \n  So, if you watch my channel for any length \nof time or actually even watch my full day   of eating video, which I'll link for you \nat the end of this one. You ll notice   that there s one food, this next one here \nthat I actually eat every single morning,   and it is ginger. And you might have been told a \nlong time ago that if you had an upset stomach,   it's good to sort of ease nausea, but it goes way \nbeyond that. It's a powerful anti-inflammatory   and in my world, it's one of the best ways to \nactually minimize the late onset muscle soreness   after a hard workout. And we all know that if \nyou can't train because of muscle soreness or   can't give a good effort in the gym, then how are \nyou going to make real gains? You need to be able   to control this. And there are studies that show \nthat taking just two grams of it a day are enough   to decrease delayed onset muscle soreness by \nup to 25%, particularly helpful for those that   like to incorporate slow eccentric training \ninto the workouts, which is one of the known   drivers of delayed onset muscle soreness. \nHowever, even if you never lifted a weight at all,   the anti-inflammatory benefits system wide are \nundeniable. Now how do you get it? It's actually   quite simple. You can either take the actual \nginger root and powder it up and put it into   certain recipes, or you can drink ginger tea \na couple of times a day. Or like I like to do,   I just take the pickled ginger, as you \nsee here. I kind of throw it on my eggs.   Trust me, it's not gross. And all I need is about \nthis much to meet my daily requirements. \n  The fact is, if I didn't think this food was \nthat important, I would have actually made an   entire video dedicated to just it. I'll link \nthat one for you at the end of this video as   well. But the point is, figure out a way to get \nginger in your diet. Whether you eat it, drink   it or smash it. The key is, get more of it.\nAnd of course, when it comes to building muscle,   we have to talk about protein at some point, but \nnot all protein is considered equal. And sure,   there's a lot of debate about how much protein \nyou need, but I don't think we get enough lean   protein. What I mean by that is what is the \nprotein in its natural state? We need to   start there. So, if you're talking about a steak, \nit's just a steak. And if you talk about chicken,   it's just the grilled chicken. If you're talking \nabout fish, well, you know it's fish, you get the   idea here. And maybe even vegetarians, \nwe re just talking about the lentils,   not the whole recipe. And I think that's where we \nmaybe start to screw things up a little bit. \n  Look how you start to prepare your meal actually \nwill determine whether or not you're on the right   path or not. So, like grilled citrus chicken is \na good start because I don't think you're going   to go and then throw Alfredo sauce on top of it. \nAlfredo and citrus are not really a good mix. But   of course, in the process by making that right \ndecision, you preserve the nutrient value of the   protein itself without kind of messing it up. In \ncontrast, I could have chosen a chicken parmesan   and thought, well, I'm still getting my protein. \nBut you're also getting the fried breadcrumbs,   the cheese, and probably a whole hell \nof a lot of pasta to go with it.\n  I guess all I'm asking you to do is take a simple \nstep back and evaluate not just if you're eating   your protein, but how you're eating them because \nhow you eat them matters. Introducing other things   that you don't need into your body at the same \ntime that you're getting a protein is not the end   objective here. What is helpful is actually making \nthe right choices. This is where something like a   protein powder comes in incredibly helpful and \nconvenient because it strips out all the things   that you don't need. Our RX PRO30G supplement, \nbrand new actually, available over at atleanx.com   is a high quality, protein 30 grams per \nserving with 28 servings per bag. \n  Cheap plug aside guys, remember the old saying \nyou are what you eat, it's actually very true.   If you want to be a better version of \nyourself, you've got to eat better food.   And these are five powerful foods that are \nvery easy to implement into your diet right   now and are going to benefit you I guarantee.
