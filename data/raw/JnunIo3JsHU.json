    "transcript": "40 more what's up guys jeff cavaliere athletenext.com and jesse what are you doing with that cool myself off why don't you try drinking it it's not a bad idea so today we're talking about a simple bodyweight workout routine actually mike tyson's bodyweight workout routine because believe it or not mike tyson back in his heyday literally built this body using mostly calisthenics matter of fact he didn't even touch weights until he left jail and on that note guys we're talking about mike's athletic ability here obviously his personal conduct outside the ring got him in trouble and a lot of people have different opinions about that we're here to talk strictly about his athletic abilities because as i said in his heyday he's at the top of the kingdom right the the king of the jungle that being said jesse wanted to see if he could be king of the jungle he tried mike tyson's body weight workout routine tried it tried it how'd you do it i don't think i did so all right so let's show them exactly what you did well if you're going to show them you better speed this up because it takes a while we might have to speed it up just a tad but guys let's break it down here exactly what mike was doing exercise by exercise [Music] [Laughter] you [Music] i mean pal you okay here we're talking about some sit-ups some bench tips some push-ups a couple shrugs a couple squats and that's what we're talking about you tried five times big guy how many times five i mean you did have the option to do it ten times half the amount yeah 10 times guys what mike actually did i i'm picking on justice this was his final round of what we're talking about here mike would break it down into chunks throughout the day little bite-sized pieces right and he would either do 50 or 100 bench dips 50 or 100 push-ups right if he was doing it five times to do the higher number if he was doing it 10 times to do the lower number 50 to 100 weighted shrugs 100 to 200 of those grueling sit-ups that jesse was doing and he would do 100 to 200 squats i will say jesse you kind of got off easy i didn't see you do the the mike tyson squat workout oh i did it you want to roll it oh we did that too oh we did that too oh let's look at that run it all right so what jesse's referring to here is the tyson squat workout that he did with just a simple deck of cards right and what we do is we just lay ten cards down on the ground and the first thing he does is he squats down and i pick up the card then he slides over just a couple inches and he squats down again and put that card down okay so now he goes down and picks up i pick up the first card and then i squat back down and i pick up the second card so then you slide over and then i put down card yep squat put down a card squat pick up a card squat pick up a card pick up a card right so now you're at five so he worked his way up so where he ultimately was done he was doing 19 squats at the end to drop all nine cards down and then pick all 10 of them back up and there was his 100 total repetitions so he'd work his way up to 100 and sometimes even work his way back down but that is the way that he actually started to attack the squads and make them a little bit more interesting now how does this work does it even work at all well let's talk about it so what's the verdict jesse does it work oh it definitely works we're not going to judge based off of jesse but i will tell you that we're not going to judge based off of mike tyson either guys i will tell you this don't ever underestimate the power of calisthenics or body weight training when it comes to building a better physique and being explosive and being strong and athletic you can do all the above with bodyweight exercises matter of fact i mentioned strength there are some exercises that are so challenging for people to be able to do let's just say throw one out there a few one-armed chin-ups right there's things that can test your strength as well however what most people do is they use them for conditioning they use them for like lighter exercises as burnout exercises don't limit them to just that you can build muscle if you program your calisthenics exercises properly that being said guys he would ride a bike like jesse's doing here just ride a stationary bike but what he did was he would up the intensity of the bike the pedal resistance was set high and he still would try to pedal at a fast rate for 20 to 30 to sometimes up to 40 minutes and you can blow your quads up and your hamstrings by simply riding on a stationary bike as long as you're willing to up the resistance level again something people don't often do they keep the resistance low they pedal for a long duration and they use it as a calorie burner they're going for a sunday ride you're going for a sunday ride not mike tyson and neither should you and lastly guys will be remiss not to talk about mike's weight loss because as you know he's getting ready for his fight as i mentioned in the beginning here with roy jones jr and he's lost a ton of weight as you can see here from these photos the fact is mike is actually back to eating meat for a while it was known that he had become a vegan which helped him lose over a hundred pounds but now he's back to eating meat and he's eating it more responsibly according to him he's avoiding processed foods a lot of stuff that you hear with us talk about here i don't think he's eating gummy bears jesse the fact is he's getting himself in tip-top shape by caring about his nutrition the other thing is he's talking about doing additional conditioning and cardio every day for two hours i will tell you this guys i'm gonna be straight about this you don't have to do that in order to be ripped and lose weight i talk about all the time the more you're willing to get your nutrition in check the less of that you're gonna have to do now that being said your heart is extremely important as an athlete and as a human being so you should treat it well and you should condition it and you should train it like you train your other muscles obviously mike's got this down with two hours of a day of conditioning work but it's just not necessary when it comes to being lean you can be very low on the spectrum in terms of using any type of conditioning however you still have to be very dialed in then in terms of your nutrition if you're going to go that route all right so there you have it mike tyson's bodyweight workout and i think jesse i think you're ready to take him up man yeah you mean a 100 pound difference it doesn't matter this is a tune-up fight for him you'd be the real main event no you know what i know mike i'm gonna actually tell him and i'm gonna set this up so guys there
