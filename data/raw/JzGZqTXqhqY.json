    "transcript": "So, there's no debating here, dumbbells \nare absolutely going to help you to   build bigger shoulders, but if you really \nwant to see some gains from time to time,   at least you're going to have to put at \nleast one of those dumbbells down.\n  What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, anthleanx.com. \nWe continue our series today. I'm going to show   you how to build the perfect shoulders \nwith just dumbbells. The thing--\n  Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, is that my \ncue? All right, so perfect shoulders -- wait   you're going to have to move out of the \nway because you're not going to fit in   here. Ugh, look at these delts. \nOh my God. Perfect Jesse? Listen,   maybe improved, perfect no. \nAre you sure? Look at that, the profile. \n  From any angle, honestly, from any angle. Listen \nguys, obviously perfection is in the eye of the   beholder, right? It's relative. However, even \nif you get close to perfect you're going to look   really damn good. And what I'm going to show \nyou here today is eight things that you can do   with just dumbbells. As a matter of fact, \ndumbbells enable you to do this more than   anything else in the gym. So, with that said, \nlet's start breaking them down one by one. \n  So, look, if you want to build big shoulders, \nyou've got to make sure you can actually   train your shoulders. And it's important that \nwe warm the shoulders up before we even do that,   because we know that's the most vulnerable joint \nin the body of injury, given that it has some of   the most mobility of any joint in the body. So, we \nstart right here at the light side of the dumbbell   rack with a light dumbbell to do this little \nwarmup. It's a simple dumbbell halo that, again,   is perfectly done here with a dumbbell because \nit's very convenient. You go around your head   both clockwise and counterclockwise with the end \ngoal being to work on warming up the rotational   aspect of your shoulder. Extra rotation and \ninterpretation, something that is very much   ignored by most people, which sets them up for \ninjury when they attack their shoulder workouts.   Secondly, you want to come across your body with \nthis dumbbell sword raise. And here again, we're   working on getting some of that extra rotation, \nbut also transitioning to getting your arm across   your body, which, as you'll see here in exercise \nthree, is another very important requirement   of healthy shoulders. And that's what this right \nhere with the dumbbell cauldron we're working on,   bringing those shoulders really far across \nour body as far as we can, by making these big   sweeping circles or caldrons, as the exercise is \ncalled. The bottom line here, guys, is warming up   your shoulders is a requirement for making the \ngains that you're seeking here. The dumbbell   makes it really, really easy to do.\nOkay, so that you're all warmed up,   the next thing we're going to do is actually start \nbuilding those shoulders up. And for God's sake,   guys, do me a favor, start training your front \ndelts. Look, I've heard it before you don't have   to train your front delts as long as your bench \npressing. Well, you don't have to train your front   delts as long as your bench pressing if you're \nnot looking for perfect shoulders. If you want   perfectly developed shoulders, you're going \nto have to start to include some additional   front delt work with some direct exercises. \nWe're not talking complicated here, guys.   Dumbbell press outs will work incredibly \nwell here. Dumbbell front raises a classic   front delt builder. The fact is we can apply some \nfocus tension to the front delts and get more   hypertrophy. And again, when the goal is building \nthe perfect shoulders, we're not looking for just   good enough, we're looking for the best. \nWhich brings us to another important point   here. If you want to explore the maximum capacity \nof growth in your shoulders, figure out a way to   get more stretch and more range of motion like \nthis. This is the leaning side lateral raise.   You can see that by simply just changing the \norientation of my body, that the dumbbell is   actually crossing midline and applying a greater \nstretch to the middle delt before I go into every   single repetition, I get the benefit of the \nstretch reflex for better growth. The second   exercise we can do can target the front delts in \nmuch the same way, and it's just an incline front   dumbbell raise. So instead of always doing them \nstanding up, just sit down on this slight incline,   and you'll see that your shoulders will \nnaturally fall back behind your body,   placing again that slight stretch on the front \ndelt that leads right into every repetition, each   one a more powerful contraction because it takes \nadvantage of that stretch reflex once again. \n  Tip number four, if you want to build those big, \nperfect shoulders, is to make sure that you're   not limiting the heavy stuff to just the overhead \npressing exercises. That will be the same thing is   if you just did a heavy close-gripped bench press \nwhen you're trying to build your triceps and you   went light on every other exercise you did: dips, \nskull crushers or maybe even tricep pushouts.   There's a bigger capacity to grow here if you \nextend those heavy exercise options in your   arsenal. So, what I'm suggesting is you increase \nthe weight on all of the raises that you do   front, side and rear raises. Let's talk \nabout the front first. This exercise is   just a heavier than usual front dumbbell raise. \nAgain, what's actually interesting here is it's   not necessarily what you're doing on the way \nup, but what you're doing on the way down that   sparks the muscle growth. Because we know that a \nforced, heavy eccentric is going to be one of the   three main drivers of muscle growth and it's \none that you don't want to ignore when you're   trying to build perfect shoulders. Likewise, we \ncan pick up a heavier than usual dumbbell here   and do a lateral raise the same way, we call \nthis a Cheat Lateral. And again, even if I had   to utilize a little bit that momentum to muscle \nit up to the top, the goal is trying to slow   the descent of the dumbbell down, control that \neccentric and provide that impetus for growth.\n  And we don't limit it to just those two heads of \nthe delts guys, because we can attack the rear   delts in very much the same way. As a matter of \nfact, we know one of the best ways to build the   rear delts is to overload extension of the \nshoulder. Because a simple seated cable row   is actually one of the greatest ways to build your \nrear delts is typically done with heavy loads. But   if I wanted to go and stick strictly to dumbbells \nhere like we are in this video, I have two other   options here. I could simply sit at the end of a \nbench and do this little bit of an abbreviated or   scarecrow row, where I'm just bringing my elbows \nup to my sides, very short range of motion, and I   could feel that because again, these muscles don't \ntypically use heavier weights. Or I could do the   rear delt row, which is one of my favorite ways to \ntrain the rear delts heavier by simply leaning up   against a rack, pulling that arm back behind the \nbody with a little bit of a twist on the shoulder   external rotation, which will absolutely light \nup your delts. But the fact of the matter is,   guys, none of these have to be done with light \nweights and the additional weight here is enough   to spark the growth that is you're seeking.\nOk, now, having just said that, tip number five   is actually to work your way down to this end of \nthe rack and start using those light dumbbells to,   particularly for those raises. Look, it's \nimportant to overload the eccentric portion   of the rep, especially on those delts that don't \ntypically get that eccentric overload. But just as   important is to make sure that when you're trying \nto build a muscle, that you're training that   muscle and not relying on momentum exclusively \nto build the muscle up. So, what I'm suggesting   is on a front raise sometimes you want to grab \nthose light dumbbells, really light dumbbells   and go really slow. Eliminate all momentum, \ninitiate every single inch of a contraction from   that dumbbell, from your side to shoulder level, \nby and with the front delt only. And of course,   the lateral raise that you were doing standing \nbefore can be taken down to the floor for a   much different effect. With the lighter dumbbells \nyou're performing only that upper 75% of the range   of motion, which in this case is going to keep the \nfocus and attention directly on that middle delt.   There's no reprieve of the dumbbell down at \nyour side in this case. You keep that focus   and tension on from the very beginning of every \nrep to the very end of the last rep. And finally,   the rear delts guys, the W Raise done with very \nlight dumbbells as one of my favorite ways to hit   this muscle group. The key here is try to form \nthe W with your arms to ensure the rotation of   the shoulder and more importantly, the extension \nrequired to hit that rear delt with that really   laser focused effort. Guys going light is going to \nbe a requirement, there's no choice between heavy   and light, both of them are going to be needed.\nTip number six, you guys know how much I love the   face pull, but we don't have cables are band, \nyou do have dumbbells. We have the Urlacher. \n  Is there a fly in here?\nUh, don't mind me. \n  Urlacher is your face pull equivalent when you \nhave dumbbells and dumbbells only. And you're not   sacrificing very much in the process because we \nknow that the face pole is one of the best ways to   build up the entire posterior chain, particularly \nthose rear delts in the upper back musculature.   Well, guys, you can do this with Urlacher by \nsimply sitting with a pair of dumbbells at the end   of the bench. And you'll notice that the mechanics \nof the movement are very similar. They start with   that straight arm out in front of your body and \nthey pull up nice and close to your body, maybe a   little bit more of a bicep hammer curl activation \nin this Urlacher. But when we get to the top,   the elbows are staying nice and tight, \ntucked to the body, palms facing back,   just like they do on that face pole and we get \nthe activation of the same muscles. Face poles,   Urlachers, you're never going to get away \nfrom it if you're training with me. \n  So, by now it's apparent that you could definitely \nbuild your shoulders up by using dumbbells only.   The fact is, if you really want to build them up \nat some point, you're going to want at least put   one of them down. Let me explain what I mean. If \nyou were to press a pair of dumbbells up overhead,   relatively heavy, you're going to be \nlimited by how much your core can stabilize   in the two dumbbells going up over your head \nat one time. Let's say you had a pair of 50s   pushing one 100 overhead is always going to \nbe more challenging on your core stability   than pushing 50 pounds at one time. And what that \nmeans is if you want to increase the weight that   you can press overhead, if you simply put one \nof them down on the ground, you're going to be   able to do that to the tune of 10 to 15 or \neven 20% more weight in that single hand.   And what happens is if you train that over \nand over again, you will actually build up the   strength unilaterally then when you bring them \nback together again, in that bilateral press,   you'll have more pressing strength overall. \nWe know as we get stronger, the gains will   come more easily. Guys, make sure you're not \nalways pressing overhead two arms at a time,   mixed in that one arm at a time for the best and \nmost perfect shoulders that you can build.\n  And speaking of pressing guys, make sure that \nyou're using your dumbbells to your advantage   when you are pressing with them. Because they give \nyou one of the most distinctive advantages that   dumbbells have overhead pressing that barbells do \nnot and that is the quick switch between weights   and the opportunity to do that seamlessly as a \ndrop set. Look, pressing with a barbell is great,   but when we're trying to utilize drop sets with \nbarbells that precious time lost, switching place   on and off can be made up easily by using the \ndumbbells. As a matter of fact, optimally by using   the dumbbells, we simply perform a set to failure, \nput the dumbbells back in as quick as it takes us   to reach for the next ones, we can get right back \nup into that next set. When we're looking to train   to and through failure to really tap into those \nmuscle fibers and create the overload needed for   growth, dumbbells give us an opportunity that \nbarbells just make a lot more difficult. \n  So, there you have it, guys. If you're trying to \nbuild perfect shoulders, there's eight things you   don't want to do, and you just need dumb--What \nis wrong with you. I got a stiff neck. From what?   From that tackle. What tackle. Just go on, go on. \nGuys, listen, perfect shoulders again in the eye   of the beholder, but with these eight tips, you \ncan get there yourself.
