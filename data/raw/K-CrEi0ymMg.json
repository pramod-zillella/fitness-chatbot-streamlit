    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. No, I didn't kill Jessie for not working out\nin the gym. You all remember Jessie. I've actually got Jessie here to help you\nout with a common – very common problem – that's probably caused by a lot of the\nsitting that we do. No matter whether it's due to driving, or\nworking, or just basically being inactive for a good portion of the day. That's called anterior pelvic tilt. Now, what are we talking about? Jessie, let's demonstrate what that is real\nquick. Bend your knees up. The internal pelvic tilt is where you actually\nhave your pelvis tilting forward, this way. So, the anterior pelvic tilt – go ahead\nand tilt it – is like that. So it's creating this really exaggerated arch\nin Jessie's back. I'll have him sit up in a second to show it. Versus a posterior tilt that tucks it down\nand in. The posterior pelvic tilt is caused by the\nstretching of your abs and your glutes. So what is really causing your anterior tilt,\nand what is it doing? Come on and get up on your knees, Jessie. So, the idea here is what? This is the anterior pelvic tilt. You get this exaggerate arch here and it's\ncaused by an imbalance of a bunch of different muscles, and some weaknesses in other muscles. There's a lot of ways to attack it, but there's\nreally only one right way to attack it. Most of all, it is a dominance and a shortening\nof the hip flexor here on the front side of Jessie. What it does is, it's pulling down on this\npelvis here into anterior tilt. Well, it attaches right here and is pulling\ndown, so it's into anterior tilt. The second part of this – this really exaggerated\narch – is coming as a compensation to create this extension of Jessie's body because he\ncan't be all the way over here. He's got to extend. But guess what? His glutes are not helping him to extend. Normally – okay, Jessie, go ahead and lay\nback down – normally the glutes right here would extend my hip behind my body. When it does that, look at what it's doing\nto my upper back. It's creating a relative extension of the\nupper back, relative to the lower part of my torso here. So if my glutes are weak and not doing their\njob, what's going to happen? The low back and the lumbar spine is going\nto say \"Oh, I could do it! I can cause extension!\" And it's going to be really tight and short. That's not what you want. So, when we look at this, we want to first\nof all stress a few different things. We already know Jessie's got tight hip flexors. What I want to show you – what you don't\nwant to do – is start stretching your hamstrings. Because in somebody that has anterior pelvic\ntilt, they're going to – go ahead and bend down for a second so we can show this – they're\ngoing to have a tight hamstring. Why is that? Because the pelvis is already tilted. I'm going to show you here in a second. It's already tilted so far forward that the\nhamstrings are already stretched. They don’t have anywhere else to go. Because he's already moved his pelvis this\nway, his hamstrings are tight. The pelvis isn't in that position because\nthe hamstrings are tight. The hamstrings are tight because the pelvis\nis in that position. It's a huge distinction. The pelvis is in that position because of\nthe tightness of the hip flexors. So going, and stretching tight muscles – like\nthe hamstrings – in an attempt to just stretch everything that's tight, it could actually\nmake your problem worse. So you don’t want to start stretching your\nhamstrings if you see tightness in them, if you have an anterior pelvic tilt. What you want to do instead is strengthen\nthem. At the same time that you're strengthening\nthe glutes that are inactive, that are causing the low back to do all the work. I hope this is all making sense. Then finally, you've got, again, with this\ntightness here of the hip flexors pulling down this way, right? So we have the pelvis being tilted down here. We get a stretching here of the abs and a\nweakness there because they're not really able to contract very strongly out of this\noverly stretched position. So you have to figure out a way to strengthen\nyour abs, and you have to figure out a way to stretch your hip flexors, while strengthening\nyour glutes. So we can actually do that. Jessie come on up. Abs, I've got plenty of videos here, guys. We have Washboard Wednesday devoted to 'how\nto strengthen your abs'. The main thing you want to do is not use hip\nflexor dominant ab movements. I actually have an entire video showing you\nhow to keep the hip flexor out of it when you're doing ab movements. So I'm going to link it right up here behind\nJessie's head. Make sure you do those types of ab movements\nto stop using the overlay active hip flexors. As far as the glutes – come on up – we\ncan do something here which is a combination of a lunge and a stretch. So, hold onto both of those dumbbells. So focus on the lower part of Jessie's body. He's going to turn here. What we're going to do is, we're going to\npreset his glutes and load them by stepping forward. Once we step forward here and we have the\nglutes loaded – because all the weight's in front here – these are pre-stretched. They're ready to work. If we're here, what we're going to do is come\nup into extension on the glutes. But look what's happening on this back leg\nover here. We're actually getting a stretch of that hip\nflexor at the same time that we're loading up this right glute, and then strengthening\nthe glute. So we want to be able to do both things at\nonce. So, Jessie, put the left leg back. Good. Now, put your arms out in front. Pre-stretched right here. I'm actually hitting Jessie's ass right here\non my YouTube channel. Go straight down. Never thought I'd say that. Go straight down, now he's coming up. As he extends through the hip he's strengthening\nthis glute, but he's stretching this left hip flexor out. So you want to start doing this. This is a – go ahead and do a few reps. This is a great way here. We call this a modification, or a sprinter\nlunge. Strengthen through here, stretching through\nthe back side. Drive it forward. There you go. At the end. So it's a dynamic stretch for the hip flexors\nand at the same time, like I said, strengthening those glutes on the right side. You can see by orientation of the hip flexor\nhere, it's attached to here, and it comes all the way here and attaches to our low back. So as this is being kept in this position\nall day long from sitting, we're getting this shortening – adaptive shortening – of\nthis muscle, and again, this weakness that's coming in from the glutes that's making the\nlow back overwork here. It's causing – he's falling apart. It's causing him to not only fall apart, but\nyou to fall apart, too because you are not in balance. So I hope by bringing in Jessie here, in this\nconstant barrage of information, that you've caught the key points here. Stop stretching your hamstrings. They're probably going to be tight anyway,\nbut they're not causing this problem, they're a result of this problem. Number two: strengthen those glutes. Get that ass going, again. Number three: stretch out your low back if\nit's overly tight, there's a lot of stretches to do that. Number four: stretch out your hip flexors. You can do that at the same time in one dynamic\nexercise, like I showed you. And number five: get those abs strong again\nand make sure you're not doing hip flexor dominant movements. All right, guys. I hope you've found this video helpful. In the meantime, if you're looking for a scientific\nprogram that puts the science back in what we do, I don’t make it this long and drawn\nout, but this is one of those more complicated issues to describe; we have it all step by\nstep in a program. I tell you exactly what exercises to do to\nmake sure we're not ending up with these types of imbalances that a lot of other programs\nwill leave you with. You can get that over at ATHLEANX.com in our\nATHLEANX training program. In the meantime, if you've found this video\nhelpful leave your comments and thumbs up below. Tell me you did it, and tell me what else\nyou want to see in the days and weeks ahead. All right, guys. I'll see you again soon."
