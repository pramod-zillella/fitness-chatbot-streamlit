    "transcript": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athlenex.com. \nJesse Laico, Athleanx.com. So today we have   our Ask Jeff videos, right? But this time, Jeff \ndoes the asking. I'm going to ask you a question   that I can't wait to hear the answer to. I \nactually did this on Instagram, and tons and   tons of people gave some answers that were really, \nreally incredible. I think it can be very helpful   to everyone that gets a chance to read these \nand participate. So, here's my question for you   a very important question. I'm actually going to \nfollow up with this with my answers. Okay? \n  You meet yourself walking into the gym \nfor the very first time. You can say just   three words to yourself. What are they? \nI know what you're going to start with. \n  What?\nHire Jesse Laico. \n  No, actually probably if you ask me \ntoday, I would say fire Jesse Laico. \n  Well, that's not very nice of you to \nsay. Okay. For real, though, probably   face pulls are forever. \nThat's actually pretty good. So, you get   the gist here, guys. Three words What are they? \nLet me share with you, because that one actually   brings up my first point. And that is address your \nweaknesses. And what that means is don't always   migrate towards the things that you're either \ngood at or like to do. You see, the best gains are   going to come from finding the things that you're \nnot so good at in the gym or that need the most   work and then finding a way to be consistent \nwhen incorporating them into your plan.\n  Oh, so like me working on my posture. \nYour posture, again Face Pulls are very beneficial   to most people, but they oftentimes get relegated \nto the end of the workout, or they never are done   at all. Hopefully, I've done a lot to maybe change \nthose patterns. But think about it like a golfer,   if you're always spending your time with \nthe driving range but you suck at putting,   you're not really going to ever score \nmuch better than if you go and you   have to actually work on your putting. \nSo, that's why I'm really bad at golf?\n  That's one of the very many \nreasons why you're bad golf. \n  But that's the point, guys remember. Don't \noverlook your weaknesses when your goal is   to ultimately be the best you can be. And \nspeaking of being the best you can be,   that actually leads me to my second three-word \nphrase. I guess I'm using 15 in this. But look,   it's going to spark some conversation here. And \nthat is you versus you. You see, if I were to   show you a picture of yourself with a group of \nyour friends who are you looking at first? \n  Yourself. \nYou re going to look at   yourself in a picture first? \nAlways. \n  Everyone does that. Because ultimately, guys at \nthe end of the day, we all care about ourselves   first and foremost, I'm not saying we don't \ncare about other people, but we care about   what's happening with ourselves when we're judging \nwhat's going on around us. That actually happens   in the gym, too. I think we go into the gym \nthinking that everyone's looking at us. \n  Oh, yeah absolutely. That s \nhow I started at least.\n  I did, too. I've mentioned here before, \nin college, I actually was a fairly skinny   guy working out in an area where there's a \nbunch of guys that were a lot bigger than me   and always sort of working around like this, \nlooking around thinking people--they didn't care.   They didn't care. As a matter of fact, they \nwere sort of cheering me on and rooting for me.   But the fact is, you think that you're always the \none under the microscope when you're not. The best   part about changing your mindset to always \njust wanting to be a better version of you,   is that you'll always win that game. If you're \nviewing life as a competition and you are just   making sure that you're doing one thing to get \nbetter each and every day, you're going to win   that competition every single day. \nAnd that brings me to my third little   nugget of wisdom that I would give young \nJeff on his first time into the gym. \n  Oh, I know what that one is. Rehire Jesse. \nYou know that rehire is one word, right? \n  Rehi--Oh shit, that s right. \nCan I continue, please? So, the next phrase   that I would say is, effort is everything. And it \nactually ties into the first two things we talked   about. If you know what your weaknesses are and \nyou know that your competition is yourself, then   the only thing that's going to determine whether \nor not you see the results that you want to get   for years and years down the road is the level \nof effort that you expend in your workouts.\n  And you know if you're \nshortchanging yourself there.\n  Yeah, absolutely. \nRight? You know whether   or not you're showing up and giving it your \nbest. I say all the time you could train long,   or you can train hard, but you can't do both. I \nopt for training hard, so I make sure that every   single time I go to the gym, I'm doing something \nthat I know I push myself further than I was   really willing to go. Right? And if you can get \nyourself into that space there, that is where   the best results lie. But again, if you don't \never really put in the effort just showing up,   which might be one of the things that someone \nmight say in three words, is not enough. You   have to put in the effort in addition to showing \nup, and that's where the real results lie. \n  And so, the next three words are three that \noftentimes get used far too often here,   in my opinion, on YouTube. But nevertheless, \nit's a decision point that every young lifter   sort of is presented with in terms of at least \nin their own head. And that is, Natty or not.   How do you choose to sort of pursue your path, \nyour lifelong pursuit of fitness? Right? \n  Mm-hmm.\nNow, I think what happens every young   male at some point sort of looks at someone like \nThe Rock, or they look at a guy who's much bigger   than them at the gym and they fantasize about \nwhat their life might be like if they had those   gains already. Maybe they're an athlete in high \nschool. I'll share my story in a second here. We   fantasize, well, what would it be like? I'd be so \nmuch better if I was bigger to play the sport for   me, football. So, this Natty or not question, \nthough, sort of leads to a moral question of   cheat code or not, in my opinion. \nCan I make a confession? \n  Oh, do you have something \nto share here, Jesse? \n  I do.\nOn Natty or not.\n  It's very embarrassing. \nIs this what we're going to talk about   Juicy Laico in terms of your new gains? \nNo, I never beat Contra on its own. I had   to use a Contra code. Okay. Up, up, \ndown, down, left, right, left right. B,   A start. I haven't blazed in the back of \nmy head, and I'm embarrassed of it. \n  Do you need a moment here to \nshare or are you good? \n  I'm good. \nAll right, you got   it off your chest. I never beat Contra either. \nSo, when I grew up, I said I'd share my story,   for those who've already heard it, I'll share it \nagain when I grew up my father was a physician.   He still is actually a practicing physician \nthese days. I grew up in a divorced household.   And my father threatened me that if he ever caught \nme with anything, any drugs, even alcohol, he'd   throw me out of the house. So, he said steroids, \nrecreational drugs, alcohol out of the house. So   what did I do? I actually never got drunk a \nday in my life, and that's a true story. \n  You need to loosen up. \nI was so scared of losing the   foundation of my home that I decided I'm not doing \nany of that. But what happened is what played   out ultimately for me was a sense of reward of \nachievement and accomplishment that I got because   every single thing I did was the result of my \nown achievements and my own hard work. Going   back to sort of the you versus you concept that \nwe talked about. So, I think that when you're   pursuing--when you have this this path presented \nin front of you, I'm not putting anyone down   that goes down, again, the cheat code path in \nmy opinion. But I do think that you have to   consider the long-term repercussions of this. \nAnd please don't tell me about well, it's just   TRT because I've made a video about this in the \npast. And again, I will explain this in a second   here. But I made a video where I came down rather \nharshly on the guy who said, You can't build   muscle over 35 without TRT.  \nYeah, that's bullshit. \n  It's just complete bullshit. And again, or the \nother guy that wrote in recently that said,   you can't be ripped over 40 without TRT, again, \ncomplete and utter bullshit that will cover   in my next phrase on nutrition. Guys don't sell \nyourself short that way, and please don't use   your TRT as a smokescreen for the other stuff that \nyou're doing or a cover up for it's just TRT. Guy   all of these things are enhancements to getting \nyou to a place that others maybe can't get to--\n  Naturally.\n--naturally.   I believe that with the right dedication and \nconsistency of effort, you're going to be able   to get amazing results if you put in the hard \nwork, Okay? You don't need to get there as fast   as you think you might need to get there. Jesse \nhimself took some criticism for what taking four   or five years to get to where you are now. \nYeah, and you know what? I'm kind of honestly,   I'm kind of happy with where I'm at now, \ngiven how long I've been training. And I'm   excited to see where I go from here. I don't care \nhow slow it goes, it's as long as I get there. \n  So, I'm not trying to take my father's hardline \nstance on this, guys. I recognize the medical   necessity for some people to get to a point where \nthey're at a healthy level of testosterone. But   why does it seem that most of the guys that \nquickly decide I'm low T and I need to go do   something or I need to jump on some gear? Why is \nit that they're mostly gym going, guys? That's   a good question, isn't it? Because they tend \nto want to jump to that conclusion a lot faster   because they want to get the end result of that \ninstead, put in the hard work rely on the effort   is everything approach and look at that you \nversus you and I promise you, better results   await you long term, at least healthier.\nAnd that brings us to that next three-word   nugget that I alluded to already \nhere on nutrition. And that is--\n  Oh, I know this one, I know this one. I \nhave it written down. Feed the dogs. \n  Feed the dogs? What does that mean? \nOh, that's the message from your wife. She just   wants a reminder for you to feed the dogs. \nCan I lose this book please? All right. So,   we're talking about nutrition, guys. I said that \nnutrition is where you need to focus your efforts.   I think it's as a young guy, when I first started \nout in a time when I was supposed to be getting a   lot of newbie gains, my nutrition was so bad, \nepically bad I never ate well at all. Maybe I   would have a family dinner that had good food in \nit, but the whole rest of the day I was waking up,   eating nothing but Dunkin Donuts and Hostess \ncupcakes for lunch and everything I could possibly   put my body that was bad. And I wasn't supporting \nthose early gains with better nutrition. I regret   that entirely. I think I could have made \na lot more progress early on. Ahem, Ahem,   reminds me of somebody, ahem, that I \nthink was eating, ahem, not so well--\n  Been there, done that, I know Jeff. \nBut you know, listen, you can make a lot   of progress when you do focus on your nutrition. \nYou can overcome a lot of maybe shortcomings if   you focus on your nutrition. Right? And I've been \none on here to talk about the fact that I don't do   as much conditioning as I would like, knowing the \nbenefits that I would get for my heart. However,   if you're willing to have a real dedication to \nyour nutrition and I mean consistency every single   day. Most people probably can't follow the type \nof nutrition plan that I follow. In other words,   you've seen what I eat, in my What Jeff Cavaliere \nFull Day of Eating video, and I'll link that at   the end of the video. But like, I can remain \neating that consistently day in, day out, day   in and day out. If you remain consistent with the \nnutrition guys and you focus on good, high-quality   nutrition, not only will you look your best, but \nyou'll feel your best as well. And I really think   that's where you need to focus the majority of \nyour efforts. Even if there's just three words   that I could give myself, that would be it right \nthere. And so, with that, guys, I'm actually can I   actually increase this from 15 words to 18? \nYeah, why not? \n  I mean, I'm already way over the limit. I'm \ngiving people good suggestions here. Remember,   guys, I want you to leave your three words what \nyou would tell the version of you walking into the   gym for the first time, what are you going to say? \nMake sure you leave it in the comments below.\n  I would also like to add. Consistency is key. And \nI've seen a lot of people say trust the process,   walk, don't run, they're all saying the same \nthing. Consistency is key, I just talked about   it with nutrition, but it really applies to all \nof these things here. Consistently address those   weaknesses consistently make sure that you're \nthe target of your own criticism and don't let   other people judge you and what you have to do. \nRemember to bring the effort every single time.   Stay on that path that you decide in terms of \nremaining natural and committing to it and feeling   the rewards of doing that. Focus on nutrition. \nEverything is based around consistency, and I   want to make sure that you guys can do that.\nIf you're looking for a consistent plan guys,   we have all of them available for you over at \nAthleanx.com. In the meantime, if you found the   video helpful, I can't wait to hear what your \ncomments are, make sure you leave them below.   Also, if you haven't done so, make sure you click \nSubscribe and turn on your notifications, so you   never miss a new video when we put one out. \nAll right.\n  I'll see you soon. \nOh, Jeff, can I increase this to 21 words? \n  Sadly, I'm going to think I \ndon't want to hear this.\n  It's give Jesse raise. \nI didn't want to hear this. \n  Oh, come on."
