    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today I want to start a new series here the world's fastest workout now maybe it's not the actual world's fastest workout according to the Guinness Book of World Records but it's damn fast and here's why if you're trying to build muscle I say it all the time you can either train long or you can train hard but you can't do both people are all on all sides of this equation here a lot of people think that if we lower down the effort level we can increase the duration of the workout and we can even take that to the extreme I've mentioned before in the past my wife is a barber she has pretty much giant traps and she got them from holding a pair of scissors for about ten hours a day six days a week just like this you can go to that extreme if you're willing to put in all that length and time and the load can be pretty minimal but you can go to the other side of it too you can up the effort level and you're gonna be up in the upper level here and get the job done a lot faster and the good thing is you're not even sacrificing anything the process because we're able to choose exercise selections here that mechanically allow us to continue to do work in a state that we didn't think we were able to do any more work and that in and of itself provides another stimulus for growth because of the metabolic overload benefits we get so I'm gonna go through the pain myself guys and every one of these workouts maybe Jesse will step in if I feel like he needs to but for this one here guys are gonna take you through real-time you can watch it and feel the pain with me but I want you to try it out because I want you to be convinced training along doesn't mean you're training hard you train hard you're gonna see that it can happen a lot faster than that let's start this world's fastest chess workout the goal is to get through this whole thing in 12 minutes or less alright so we're gonna set sort of a time cap of two and a half minutes per three exercise circuit and what I get into it here I'm gonna just start with my heavier exercise drop down in this case to an add duck ssin exercise the cable cross and then go down to a body weight exercise that allows me to rep it out in this case it's gonna be the pushup we'll get into the next circuit when we get there but I just want to get you going so in this circuit here now look you don't have an incline cable set up do an incline dumbbell bench alright and use a band for your crossovers so we started up here we go so they get a little bit heavier here again I want to try to load up the nice thing about this exercise and I'm also getting the resisted a deduction because the bands are set up a little bit outside of me the tables the goal here is to Train to failure it looks like you'll see quickly squeeze top slow down eccentric you Center let's look next just pop this up working on the adduction again it's a drop set but it's also a mechanical job set because this exercise I can't load as much getting the arm across the chest which ah overdrive it all the way across the chest get this hand and elbow across the chest and down push-ups again I still got something left in the tank because this is your easier exercise but I keep the intensity up and the overall workout because I keep moving here squeeze try to squeeze your hands together even though they won't move as the ground is stopped now let's come over to the other circuit about two and a half minutes in next circuit we grab forgot my dumbbells some dumbbells here we'll do a floor press as our heavy exercise Cavalier cross over with one dumbbell right up here cross keeping the dumbbell from the low to high position and then go into a dip what happens about that ah Wow take that just arts shoulders back pop up grab one dumbbell drive up and across try to momentarily squeeze and hold I'm not shrugging I'm really driving my arm up into a reduction trying to bring my bicep man towards the middle of my chest ah into dips again we're condensing the amount of work that we normally drag out into 25 30 40 minutes or longer into a much shorter period of time in this exercise but this point is already difficult raaah well just a little over five minutes in I'm covering the product placement right here back over here one more round and seriously I'm already toast these are the kind of workouts that you wake up the next day and you're shocked now how wasted you are because that workload was condensed into such a short period of time you forced your body to do something it wasn't used to and that's a good impetus for change as we want that challenge built into the workout so again here your cross so five five or six dinner you want to load that so that you're in that somewhere four to eight range on the first exercise and then in that ten to twelve on the second and then just rip out for body weight at the end and even with no rest after that it's the nature of this exercise that allows me to get more repetitions even on fatigue that's the mechanical drops in oh just did I promise I was gonna do other ones in this series Oh your step okay push number squeeze in okay okay we're good eight minutes 37 seconds staring his waist down trying to insinuate now and not let them intimidate me ah five ah and this point is killed Hey I apologized for everybody watching these at work the sound effects tell me why I should workout videos hmm by the way 10:20 I'm slacking here today all right last one distel failure all right all right here what Oh oh man double cigarettes applause my last one so they have it guys as you can see pretty wide pretty quick I want you to try this out convince yourself that you can get an overload especially if you condense it into the period of time that we did this density style training approach is something that will take you to a new level of intensity and effort in your training and a lot of times I think that's the most productive place that you can be especially if you're hanging out a little bit in the junk volume land this is where you want to try first if you're looking for programs guys we actually build this into a lot of our programs one of them in particular monster as I mentioned you can get that over at athleanx.com if you haven't already guys make sure you click Subscribe attorney
