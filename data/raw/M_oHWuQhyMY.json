    "transcript": "is your chess training onedimensional I'm going to show you today how you can incorporate 3D athlete training so you can start looking like an [Music] athlete what's up guys Jeff Cavalier athleanx.com we're going to talk about it I say it all the time with athleen X if you want to look like an athlete you've got to train like one now you still might be thinking to yourself what does that exactly mean so I figured let me zero in on a chest exercise to sort of illustrate what it is we're talking about and why it's so important that you do train more than in one dimension here like we said start training in three dimensions and you can do that if you start incorporating some of the techniques from athl X with a regular standard fly cable crossover whatever you want to call it in here when you're using cables you know we're working pretty much in one plane of motion here pretty much across the body now you know I'm not a big fan of flies especially when I say what the impact is on the stretch of the chest right just go W back and watch that video I talked about how it really doesn't increase the the stretch on the chest more than the bottom position of a bench breast does but what happens here is you start to actually compromise the anterior shoulder capsule a little bit when you go too far out I've seen guys get hurt literally in the middle of a single rep of a cable crossover so how can we get more out of it make it more three-dimensional at the same time Mak it a more athletic explosive and rewarding exercise well we're going to sort of athle and exify this exercise and we're going to do it in a different way now my version of a cable crossover would be get wide stance again you do this with a band you don't have to have a cable machine or anything like that but we start in here okay across here so right away I've already got core involvement because this is trying to pull me back in that direction so if I'm going to stay over here I have to be able to sort of contract my whole uh AB oblique region right right in here now from here I'm going to turn across my body and get in here for my crossover so I'm essentially punching across my body right in through here okay and then back now you want to make it a little bit more explosive a little bit more Dynamic we all know that you don't just push push push when you're doing anything no matter what whether you're playing a sport or you're not you got to sort of reciprocate that with a pull so if we're in here we're going to pull back first and then across the body into a pull a push pull back and across now we have rotation going on so we already have the core working we definitely have the chest lit up here we're not subject to that big big stretch out here that could hurt our shoulder so we're basically left with an explosive Dynamic multi- segmented Mo motion here that's got three dimensions we have a pole back we have rotation we're coming back in the straight away sagittal plane frontal plane as we go across our body and rotation so all all at the same time in here so if you want to light up your inner chest then you work with this exercise again a different version of the crossover so if I wanted to then I go back other side same thing you can see it working from the back in here and then across the body in back and then across in and across okay much different you can see balance it out obviously right side left side work on both guys you can keep training the way you're training and you can keep looking the way you're looking or you can start tying in muscle groups that want to work together and do what we say start training like an athlete and that's what athletex is all about if you have an already guys try the difference see it for yourself you don't need a c machine you can just take one band pull it back do your regular crossover then try this and see and feel the difference you're going to feel a lot more working from your feet all the way up to your hands and across your body in that one exercise you'll see what it is to train like an athlete and then if you pick up the program 90 days from now guys you're going to see what it's going to feel like to look like an athlete head to athleten x.com right now grab the program we'll be back here again next week more videos add your comment below tell me what it is that you'd like to see next i' like to take your feedback let me know what kind of video you want to see and we'll get it in the queue here ready for you to see it I'll see you back here in [Music]"
