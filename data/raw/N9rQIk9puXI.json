    "transcript": "all right guys got a beginner follow along ab workout here today i'm gonna do it with you all right we just got six exercises it's perfect for beginners we're gonna do our best to keep the hip flexors out of the exercises because a lot of times beginners feel it more in their hip flexors or their back that's not what we're going for we're going for just your abs here guys remember 45 seconds on if you can't do the entire exercise go for as long as you can 15 seconds rest the first exercise is going to hit those lower abs it's called a butterfly reverse crunch get down on the ground here remember 45 seconds and five four three two one legs are open and out just bring them together and lift up open them on the bottom squeeze them together and lift up again most of the time we do reverse crunches we're relying on the hip flexors to pull ourselves back into position however a lot of times that can yank on your low back and cause some pain we're not doing that here if anything we've got our our adductors a little bit more activated here that's not a bad thing because our groin muscles tend to be pretty weak again lift squeeze try to clear that tailbone off of the ground five seconds good remember if you can't go for the entire length of that time go for as long as you can and keep going each time you do the workout next one up is the opposite knee to elbow so we get into this unhands plank position and we're going to drive our knee in just like that right elbow to left knee left elbow to right knee every time when you bring it in squeeze try to contract your abs don't just tap them try to contract and squeeze [Music] by squeezing and really focusing on contracting the abs you kind of minimize that dominance of the hip flexors good take those 15 seconds of rest you're doing good we move on to the next exercise it's a side plank variation called the kickstand side plank get in position on one elbow keep the other hand down on the ground to actually help you what you do is push and lift up right here use that other hand for support if needed but what i'm trying to do is squeeze through the obliques to make this work we got two sides here we're gonna do it twice first on the right side which is the bottom side here being worked then we're gonna flip over and go 45 seconds on the left this works out what we call pillar strength or lateral pillar strength of our core good hit those 15 seconds in position on the opposite side [Music] so far so good hand in position and here we go flipped the kickstand comes from this assistant's hand [Music] even if your hip flexors tend to still kick in a little bit too much even on that last exercise with the opposite knee elbow if they got fatigued this exercise is going to give them a nice rest in between [Music] good halfway home three to go you can do it this one's going to be what we call a mid-range exercise where both the top and the bottom move together it's a hands back knee thrust hands are behind you you're going to pull one leg in and alternate drive in really again try to get that good hard squeeze on your abs you can see i'm crunching and flexing at the same time right coming forward bringing my chest towards my knee at the same time that i'm bringing it in to get that spinal flexion that we know engages the abs and again by doing it in this alternating fashion i get a little reprieve of the hip flexors rather than having to have them perform this move at the same time together good 15 seconds now we get into that unhands position again it's a plank toe tap we're gonna get top down rotation hands are on the ground my goal is to touch my opposite toe reach rotate and squeeze again these aren't just passive exercises then i'm just looking to complete the motion i'm looking to contract and squeeze through really work the abs teach yourself how to engage your abs it's really important for beginners to learn how to do that so i'm squeezing through here squeeze how much time we got here 10 seconds squeeze see it's even worked for me remember if you can't get it all the way through for the entire time you go for as long as you can and build up good now last one good way to end it is the frog crunch so we're gonna open those legs again and what we're doing here is again trying to take the hip flexors out of it just performing a simple crunch with the goal being to lift your shoulder blades up off the ground and again no yanking on the neck never when we crunch just kind of keep them supported gently near the sides of your head because the arms being back here is additional weight that you have to lift so if they were here you can make it easier and maybe you need to do that right now but if not the additional weight of the arms back here is more work but just not there to start pulling your yanking on the neck well you can do this we're almost done last five seconds finish strong and done if you want to keep going go for an additional round take it through click that button below that linked so you can rewind it right to the beginning of the second round that's it guys again beginners everybody starts somewhere intermediate can do this too just take it for longer durations the ab workout is designed to help everybody guys if you're looking for complete programs we have them all over atlantis.com of course meal plans too because they're going to help you to show the abs that you're working on all right guys hope you liked it we'll back here soon see ya"
