    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. The Master Tip Series continues. This time, the abs. there actually is a master tip that applies\nto every, single ab exercise. Remember, the Master Tip – to qualify as\nsuch – needs to apply to every ab exercise you do. It needs to not require any extra equipment,\nor experience in order to be able to pull it off. It also needs to be able to be something you\ncan do immediately the next time you train your abs. Finally, the damned thing has to work. I say that all the time. This one does work. I'm going to show you what the big problem\nis when it comes to ab training. When we do a side crunch this is what it looks\nlike. Now, you tell me if you can see what I'm doing\nwrong. Okay, I'm crunching. Now I'm not grabbing with my neck here. That's one of the – you can't do this. That's one of the worst things. But that wouldn't apply to every exercise. What I'm having a problem with, and what we\nneed to fix; we have to stop isometrically contracting the abs, or the obliques – or\nwhatever muscle group that we're trying training here – and running through the rest with\nthis isometric hold. What we're doing here, if you look closely,\nis we're getting one, single, isometric contraction here, and then we're moving our body. You see people do this all the time. Look at how much movement I have going on\nup here, at the top. But I'm not eccentrically lengthening, or\neven concentrically shortening this muscle at any point in time. What would look better, and what we need to\nstart doing, is allowing the full cycle of contractions. So if I come down I'm letting it go, and then\nI come up, into a full contraction, and then I let it go. Eccentrically lengthen, and then I come up\ninto a full contraction. A lot of people have said that they don’t\nfeel the contractions so much in their abs. It's hard to feel it when you're isometrically\nlocking yourself into this very tiny range of motion and not ever eccentrically lengthening,\nso from that elongated position you could actually shorten. That's why you can't feel the contraction;\nbecause you're not ever really getting to a longer position to then shorten from. So it applies to a crunch on your back, too. We look like this when we do our crunches. We're up here, we crunch, and we go up, and\ndown. Like that. Again, forget about what you're doing up here. Of course, you don’t want to be ripping\non your head here, like that and pulling on your neck. But what we're doing is, we're getting into\nthis isometric contraction here, and then we're lowering our shoulders down, but we're\nnot letting the abs relax. It's this constant isometric. Try them. You can feel what I'm talking about. When you come down you want to let it go,\nand then contract, and let it go, and contract. I'm not talking about hyperextension here. The floor is stopping me from that. I'm just talking about letting that contraction\ngo so you can actually shorten, and get a stronger contraction. If we're up on a bar, this is where it's done\nwrong almost all the time. We're up here, people do a leg raise, they\nget into this position here, and then they just move their knees up and down, off that\none contraction of the abs. Now you might be thinking to yourself \"But\nwait. If we're contracted the whole time isn't that\nbetter?\" No. To get full development of a muscle group\nyou wouldn't just contract once isometrically and then move the joints around it. That would be the equivalent of taking your\nbicep here, get it to this position, and then move your arm up and down during a curl. You're not getting optimal development of\nthe biceps by doing this. You're getting optimal development of the\nbicep by going to eccentric lengthening of the muscle, and then shortening the muscle. The same thing happens here. We get up on the bar, we shorten – remember,\nguys, show your ass here. You get your ass up. But when you come down you let it lengthen\ninside the abs. Shortening in here, lengthening the abs. shortening, lengthening the abs. It's not just holding on for dear life with\none isometric, and moving your legs up, and down. Finally, even if I did a bench exercise here,\nlike a seated knee tuck. Again, you see this all the time. Guys are in here, they come up, and they press. Now, I'm not talking about even a shortened\nrange of motion because you could look like you have full range of motion here, but if\nI'm just isometrically holding – remember, we're stronger isometrically than we are concentrically,\nso we're really not challenging the abs as much as we can. That's not what we're looking for. We want to get the eccentric lengthening here,\nof the abs, and then in. Eccentrically lengthen, in. Lengthen, in. Lengthen. Okay? Get all the way out, and then come back in. Don’t just hold onto that contraction. Again, the Master Tip is one that you can\napply through every, single exercise. This can be done no matter what exercise you\ndo. Other than, let's say, a plank, which isn't\nnecessarily an isolated ab exercise anyway. You need to have some movement in order to\nbe able to have that done. A plank is an isometric in, and of itself. So guys, the Master Tip is designed to help\nyou get more out of the exercises that you do. We all do a lot of the same exercises, but\nit's how you do them that determines what you get out of it.
