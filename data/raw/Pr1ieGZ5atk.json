    "transcript": "today we're talking about how to do the\nhanging leg raise and not just hit your abs but also your obliques and maybe\neven your hip flexors guys you might actually need to do that I'm going to\nalso show you some modifications to the exercise to make sure anybody can do it\nand also some alterations in case one of your shoulders\nmaybe prevents you from doing it right now what's up guys jeff cavaliere\nathleanx.com so let's talk about how to do the hanging leg race everybody talks\nabout this being a great ab exercise and it is and the reason is is because the\nweight of the legs is being used as your resistance here which makes it more\ndifficult but also more rewarding people who jump up on the bar and we can work\nas I said we can work the ABS we can work the obliques and we can even work\nthe hip flexors now you might be saying to yourself why would I want to be\nworking the hip flexors honestly guys a lot of quad strains come from having\nweak hip flexors so what you want to do though is work on raising the legs past\n90 degrees so if you were to do that you have to focus on where you're bending\nright if you bend here at the hip socket and you can even bend your knees a\nlittle bit more if you had to to get there you want to lift and focus on\nlifting straight through the hip socket up and above 90 degrees okay so from\nhere to here that's going to turn that into predominantly a hip flexor exercise\nagain strengthening those can sometimes offset some of the load that the quads\ntake on that leads to chronic quad strain so that's how you want to do it\nif you're getting those next your abs to do the ABS I've used this cube before to\nshow your ass it's really effective what you want to do is jump up on the bar and\nnow the focus is on bending not just in the hip socket here right\nbut bending at the pelvis trying to curl your pelvis up so from here the focus is\nnow on getting my ass to you okay out in front to you right straight out by doing\nthat we're flexing the spine and using majority here the abdominal muscles to\ndo that job now caution on how high to go people do these exercise and they\nturn them into a toaster bar what happens when we do that we're going to\nhigh Y if I take up and I go all the way up to here\nI can stay here for a long time the reason is because once I get my legs\nall the way up gravity is now pushing and acting straight down through the leg\nwith very little resistance if I have my legs dropped even 20 degrees from here\nright to there it becomes way harder because gravity is now pushing down on\nmy legs making my absolute more work so don't go too high\nfinally obliques this is actually one of the best of leak exercises you could\npossibly do all it matters is once again where are you bending from don't bend\nfrom here don't bend from here bend from here watch the difference grab up now\nI'm trying to flex out my ribcage my legs are inconsequential all I do is\ncome here and flex there and up there with a twist there so you can see\ndepending upon where you concentrate on initiating the curl from you can\ndetermine which muscle does the majority of the work now we talked about\nmodifications it's a lot harder to hold on and support your body weight here but\nyou could do the same three exercises right here in captain's chair as you see\nme doing you can still do the flexing for the hip you can still do the curls\nfor the ABS you can still do the twist with that bending here in the obliques\nto hit that area more effectively and also if you have an issue in your\nshoulder maybe a bad labrum tear something that makes it hanging from a\nbar a little bit difficult once again the captain's chair is gonna\nbe your friend so you can bear the weight through your elbows and forearms\nas opposed to having to hang all of your weight on the bar guys I hope you found\nthis video helpful I'm looking to cover as many of these common exercises that\nyou want me to cover here and break it down and put the science behind this\ntraining just let me know what you want me to do I'll do that for you in a\nfuture video if you're looking for a program that breaks this all down and\nalways putting the science back on the strength those are over at athleanx.com\nalright guys see you again soon remember please subscribe you don't have to smash\nit it's fine with just a touch and make sure you're trying to notifications so\nyou never miss a video hi guys see you soon"
