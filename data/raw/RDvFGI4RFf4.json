    "transcript": "What's up, guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com. \nSo today I'm putting myself in the corner,   I guess we can call it the coach's corner, \nbecause I'm going to go over a question and I'm   kind of going old school back to the brick wall to \nanswer it. And the question is, why are gymnasts   so frickin strong? And I guess for that matter, we \ncan throw in there calisthenics, athletes, anybody   who really can command their body weight in space. \nI mean, look at this guy right here. That's pretty   damn strong. As a matter of fact, the guys in the \nbackground who are lifting weights are in awe of   what he's doing here. And that's what happens \noftentimes with these impressive calisthenics   and bodyweight type exercises. They're not \nreally capable of being done by everybody,   even the strongest athletes. So, it begs the \nquestion, how do these guys get so strong? Well,   I think you have to actually ask yourself first, \nare they actually strong? Right? Are they,   by definition of strength, actually strong? \nWe're talking about the ability to produce force   against an external resistance. And \nwe're talking about, more importantly,   absolute levels of strength. Look, Jesse's strong, \nhe's gotten way stronger, but he's not as strong   as Thor Bjornsson. And even though Thor outweighs \nhim by about 1,000 pounds, it's actually not being   used to his advantage when we're just talking \nabout absolute strength, the fact is he can lift   more than Jesse, he's stronger than Jesse.\nBut when we look at these movements again,   we realize you have to be strong to do them, so is \nthere a secret? Well, I think the first thing we   need to consider is the body weight of the people \ndoing the exercise. And oftentimes, yeah, they are   going to be lighter guys that do these exercises \nbut that's where the concept of their relative   strength comes in. They're able to take that body \nweight and command it in space and ways that a lot   of us cannot. And certainly there's other reasons \nthat cause that but it does demonstrate a level of   relative strength that's pretty damn impressive. \nNow, that doesn't mean that at the same guy   went and stepped over that trap bar in the \nbackground there that he can actually lift that.   I'm just saying, though, it's an indicator that \ntheir relative strength could be high, but the   letter body weights are definitely something that \nallows you to move your body in space easier.   Let's face it, a guy who weighs 260 pounds might \nstruggle to do more than five or six pull ups.   However, with everything, there are exceptions, \nand this guy right here certainly dispels the   myth that big guys can't command their body \nin space. Which brings us to the second point,   and that is leverage. Leverage is one of the \nkey things that helps us to do what we do,   whether it be with weights in the gym or \nwhether it be with our own body weight.\n  Think about when you do a deadlift. If you are \neven over the bar by an inch further than you   should be, your ability to break that bar off \nthe ground is going to be incredibly challenged.   The same thing would be, let's say, with a bench \npress, if your elbows drift even an inch forward   or an inch back, your forearms are no longer \ncentered directly underneath the bar and your   ability to produce the force and leverage to get \nthe bar off your chest is going to be diminished.   Now, when it applies to the calisthenics or \nthe gymnast, they basically have the ability   to align and orient their center of mass in a \nway that effectively lightens their body weight.   Even at these already light body weights, they \ncan take what's there and make it lighter and   that's key. If you think of an exercise like \nthe human flag, a lot of us can't even get   in position to do this. But they have mastered \nthe ability to get the perfect amount of push   and the perfect amount of pull on that bar behind \nthem that almost makes their body float up as if   it's effortless. The same thing can be said \nabout a planche being able to almost balance   their body in space as opposed to making their \ntriceps work like hell to hold them there.\n  And the same thing can be said about any \none arm variation of, let's say, a pushup   or even a pull up, both of these become so much \neasier where you know how to manipulate your body   in space as you do the exercise, to take advantage \nof those leverages to work in your favor.   But I always point to this other concept, and that \nis the ability to get your stabilizers working for   you as well. So not just leverage, but how to \nrecruit stabilizers to the exercises that you   do throughout the exercise, and this is where \ncalisthenics athletes have mastered the concept.   Because we talk about this thing called \nenergy leaks. When you do a pull up,   how you do the pull, it matters. I've gone through \nthis in great detail in previous videos, so much   so that I say if you can just learn to keep your \ncore tight and your shoulders packed and even your   quads contracted, you can remove the looseness \nfrom your body that oftentimes dissipates the   force that you're generating into the bar and robs \nyou of the pull ups that you're capable of doing.   When you do this properly, the number of pullups \nyou can do instantly goes up like literally in   the next set. And the same thing applies to the \npushup to when you can engage the right muscles   and provide stability and rigidity through your \nbody, it moves more efficiently through space.\n  The front lever is another example of this \nto being able to keep those glutes contracted   and the core engaged is going to make your \nbody float up, particularly if you know how   to engage the lats and utilize them as the \nmain driver of the movement. These are all   things that you may not have naturally unless \nyou work at these exercises and these skills.   Now, if you're in the weight room, how does \nthis apply? Well, think about a bench press.   When was the first time that you actually learned \nhow to utilize your legs and produce leg drive   during the exercise? When you did, you likely \nincrease the amount you could lift instantly.   Casey Mitchell has been in this gym before, and \nhe has swarmed that even through just that one leg   he can generate an additional 40 of force into his \nbench press to increase his overall strength. It's   important so when you learn, though, that this is \nactually not just driving the bar up on its own   but getting your low back into an arch position \nthat stabilizes the entire back and assist with   keeping your shoulders down and back, it increases \nyour ability through increased stability. So,   the concept is the same, but we need to learn how \nto do it through all of the exercises that we do.   But I think you have to look into the specific \nexercises that oftentimes are being done   with gymnasts and body weight athletes.\nAnd we talk about isometrics, there's a lot   of research backing the efficacy of isometrics \nin terms of increasing your strength levels,   although it's within a defined range of motion. \nSo, if you're performing the isometric in let's   say the mid-range position of a curl, well \nyou're increasing the strength within that   range of the curl and maybe a little bit up and \na little bit down. Well, again, the benefit of   bodyweight athletes is that they're not usually \njust performing isometrics in one portion of the   range of motion of the exercise. Even just through \nthe attempts at getting better at the exercise,   they're performing isometric holds for that \ntemporary body control at different points   along the range, which just increases that overall \nstrength. And most of these calisthenics exercises   actually do require full range of motion. So, the \ntime under tension that's generated through these   exercises is off the charts, which also goes \ninto and feeds into their ability to not just   get better at the exercise, but to get stronger at \nthe movement as you perform them. And you cannot   have any discussion about calisthenics exercises \nwithout talking about the built-in fun factor,   can I say, or at least the challenge of being \nable to perform something that you couldn't do   even a day ago or a week ago? Look, when I was \ntrying to do this exercise here, I didn't get   it the first time or the first 100 times.\nIt took me quite a while to be able to get to   the point where I could balance myself. And yes, \nit was about learning the leverages. It was about   learning how to create that stability and \nrecruitment of those stabilizers. It was   also about being able to just conquer the damn \nexercise, right? Wanting to get better at it. And   as I attempted and failed and attempted and failed \nand each time got a little bit closer to the point   where I was like, oh, that was 5 seconds, oh, I \ncan hold it for seven. I wanted to actually, I   just got really competitive. Well, guess what that \nbrought with it the natural increase in volume   that comes along with trying and trying and trying \nagain. And we know that at sub maximal lows, the   volume increases are oftentimes capable of driving \nthe gains that we're looking for. Now, don't   confuse the fact that some of these exercises, as \nI just mentioned, could be sub maximal. It doesn't   mean that all of them are sub maximal. Look, we \ncould talk about a one arm chin up. If you could   only do one, one arm, chin up with maximal effort. \nHow is it different than, let's say, one overhead   press with maximal effort, at least in terms of \nyour ability to exert the force required to do   the exercise? It's still a maximal effort.\nSo, overload is possible, and we know through   overload we can create muscle gains in strength. \nSo again, we can see very easily how these   exercises can do that. The bottom line is, \nI say all the time, if you want to get the   best of all worlds, you've got to do both. You \nwant to dedicate some portion of your training   to classic strength training and work in the \nweight room and trying to build up that absolute   strength because it's only going to serve you \nwhen you go back to doing that other really   important aspect of training that sometimes gets \noverlooked. And that's the body weight mastery,   trying to learn how to command your body in \nspace. When we're talking about athletics in   the realm of athletic training, you've got \nto be able to do both. As a matter of fact,   there's ten calisthenics exercises that I believe \nevery single person should do, regardless of what   training style you're following right now. I'm \ngoing to link that video for you here. If you   found this video helpful, and you like this style \nof video, make sure you leave your comments below   and tell me about it.
