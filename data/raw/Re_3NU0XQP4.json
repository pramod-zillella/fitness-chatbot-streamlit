    "transcript": "when it comes to tricep exercises there are no shortage of options however which exercises do you focus on if you're struggling to build your arms right now you're going to want to watch to the end of this video because I'm going to give you the two exercises that you need to focus on if you want to start seeing your best results now Others May want you to believe that there's only two exercises that you need and that all other types of exercises just don't provide any additional benefit that's not what I'm saying but if you don't have these two boxes checked in combination with each other you're going to struggle to build your best tries as possible with this bare minimum approach you can be assured of the fact that you're going to have an effective combination of exercises to use and more so be able to focus on fewer things so you can get to where you want to be faster what's up guys Jeff Cavalier athletext.com look you might be surprised to hear me say only two because when it comes to tricep exercises you know that I've got a lot of options but when I talk about only two exercises I'm saying that if you're only going to do two exercises they need to check these two boxes because these are going to fill in the most amount of gaps in your triceps training with the minimalist approach now if you're looking to build your triceps you have to take a more scientific approach to how to do it and for me you got to start with that long head because it makes up two-thirds of the triceps which make up two-thirds of the overall size of your arm so for me I reach for a simple easy Carl bar and a bench to do the first exercise which is a line of tricep extension now the first thing you want to make sure you do is go heavier than you might oftentimes do because this exercise is not really meant to be an isolation move it's a compound movement that utilizes both movement at the elbow and shoulder joint so I load this thing up I get back behind me here and I go for that eccentric overload right so I'm able to get that long head on stretch and then have enough weight here to challenge me on the positive consenter portion of the rep all right so that good long eccentric stretch on the way down and up and once I reach failure I don't stop I drop right down into a close grip bench to really kind of continue the work this time more on that medial lateral head targeting that lower chest line on every rep with the bar taking this all the way to failure and both components of it is a great way to kick off there's only two exercises but remember that's only one we got another one follow me and that's where we have to reach for some version of a push down but not any version of a push down you see what I want you to do is something called a rocking push down because if we take a normal traditional push down and I hover over the top of the Rope you can see that this line of force or the cable itself is actually perpendicular to my forearm which is going to put good tension on the triceps but when I get down to the bottom where the peak contraction is supposed to happen they become a lot more parallel to each other meaning there's less force on the triceps that's not what we want remember the long head is key to the development of the triceps and you don't want to just take them through that stretch position but to more of a fully contracted position which means we got to get them back behind our body get the arm back so we can do a rocking push down by simply putting one foot up underneath the Rope stepping back with the other foot and getting up on your toe now now in this position you can see I've maintained that perpendicular position of the Rope to my forearm which is good but as I go down if I just lean into the back foot not leaning back to pull the momentum of the Rope literally driving with my triceps but the bottom I can not only get my arms back behind my body but I can keep a more perpendicular relationship between the forearm and the Rope I just come back and reload from here push down and back behind me open your chest up come in and all the way back remember this exercise is not about leaning your body weight back in order to pull the rope with you it's about executing a change in body position simply for keeping the force where it should be and making sure the triceps are doing more of the work don't fall for cheap imitations in this exercise guys doing it the right way is going to give you the gains that you're looking for remember guys a science-based selection of only two types of exercise are going to make sure that they're covering this triceps training Arc with that long head all the way up in that stretch position and then all the way back down and behind your body for a full Peak tricep contraction both the medial lateral header getting that full contraction with elbow extension if you're looking for more tricep exercises rank from best to worse you can check
