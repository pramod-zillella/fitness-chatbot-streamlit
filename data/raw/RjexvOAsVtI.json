    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Breaking out the muscle markers, yet again,\nto continue the perfect workout series. This time, hitting the legs. Guys, as always in our perfect workout series,\nwhat we’re trying to do is construct a workout that is damned close to perfect as possible. Realizing that there are a lot of ways to\nskin a cat. But if we can choose one way, what would we\ndo, and why would we do it? That’s what’s most important here. Why are we selecting what we’re selecting? To do that we always start with the anatomy\nbecause we want to understand the function of the muscles we’re trying to train. When we look at the quadriceps, we know that\nbecause of the name ‘quadriceps’ it’s got four components here. It’s got a medial component on the inside\nof the knee called the vastus medialis. We have a lateral component on the outside\nof the knee called the vastus lateralis. Go figure, we have one in the middle of the\nknee that’s not seen here because under the muscle that is seen is called the vastus\nintermedius. The one that is seen here is called the rectus\nfemoris and unlike the other three components of the quads, this one does have an attachment\nabove the hip, allowing us to have some function on the hip, in terms of its ability to lift\nyou into flexion. It’s a weak flexor at that, but at least\nit has something unique about it that we want to make sure we consider. The other three muscles, however, are able\nto, and are really good at extending the knee. That is their main focus. They start in the femur, they end across the\nknee joint, and they are able to extend that knee. Now, whether that means we’re sitting down\ndoing a leg extension – I don’t like when you do leg extensions – or you have your\nfeet in a closed chain environment with your feet in contact with the ground like a squat\n– I like squats – that will give you the same opportunity to extend your knee. We want to make sure we’re training that. On the other side we have our hamstrings. We know with the hamstrings there are different\ncomponents to this as well. We have something that’s a little more medial. We have something that’s a more lateral. The biceps femoris on the outside, the semitendinosus\non the inside, and then we have even more on the inside of the semimembranosus. A lot of different names, guys, but we have\nreasons for wanting to approach them in a strategic way. We’re going to do that for you in this workout. Then, of course, you can’t always focus\non just the sagittal plane. I know we like to walk and move in this direction,\nbut we can’t ignore the other planes of motion. Mainly, the frontal plane and the transverse\nplane. We want to make sure we’re including exercises\nto do that. Squats alone, no matter how great they are,\nthey won’t train your hips in that way. So, we’re going to do exercises to make\nsure we’re hitting the hips, the glutes, the hamstrings, and the quads. By the way, guys, there will be no muscle\nmarkers for the glutes. I know Jesse volunteered. He's been in these videos naked before. It ain’t going to happen, guys. Use your imagination. I’m going to show you why and how it is\nso critical that you get the glutes and hamstrings to function together if you want the perfect\nleg workout. With that, let’s get started. Breaking it all down, one by one. So, with all of our perfect workouts we kick\nthis thing off with a good, compound exercise. The best, when it comes to training the legs. That is the squat. What we do here with the squat is work our\nway up in a warmup fashion. In the warmups I never want you to exhaust\nyourselves in warming up. To do that, what I recommend is working your\nway up through some submaximal sets. If you can do half of what your working weight\nis going to be, then use about 20% less than what you’re working weight is going to be. Just do a few reps with each weight. Enough to – we call it ‘grease the groove’. To prepare yourself for the working sets. What I like to do individually when it comes\nto the squat is something we call a ‘touchup set’. With a touchup set we’re trying to overreach\nwith 10% of what we’re going to do in our first working set, to our five-rep max. What we do is a box squat. The box squat will allow us to get down there,\nto feel the safety, to have the confidence that we have a bottom point. It will give us that biofeedback to know ‘that’s\nwhat I’m heading for’. Give it a one or two rep touch, come back\nup, then start your working sets. What does that do, neurologically? That overreach allows us to feel more ready\nand able to attack our working sets with a lighter we fight. This, what would normally be our heavier weight,\nhas now become lighter by the performance of that one set. Neurologically, it’s a powerful tool. So now I go in a 5-5-10-25 format. We’re starting with our heavier sets here\nand what we do is work ourselves up to a 10 rep, and then a ball-busting 25 rep max because\nit's important. Training your legs to higher reps is something\nyou’re always going to want to do if, for nothing else, to train your mental fortitude. But we want to get our heavy training in as\nwell. So, I like to scale it up in this way. In between sets, one of the best things we\ncan do, as I’ve covered in our perfect back workout, is have some compression going on\nbecause of the loading of the squat. We can get a decompression component by hanging\nfrom the bar in between sets for about 30 seconds. You’re going to rest about three minutes\nbetween these work sets, and then you move onto the next component here. Now we’re going to hit the posterior chain. We have two options here. Number one: the barbell hip thrust. Again, a compound movement to hit the glutes\nand hamstrings in one, powerful movement. What this exercise does is allows us to load\nup pretty heavy. In comparison to what your option is, that\nis the glute-ham raise. I know not a lot of us have the glute-ham\nraise machine which takes it off the table right off the bat. But if you do have it, I’m going to explain\nwhy it provides some additional benefits. Although, it’s at the expense of your ability\nto load it with a lot of weight like you can a barbell hip thrust. What we do is, first and foremost, if you\nchoose a barbell hip thrust your rep sequencing here is 25-10-5-5. We’re working backward. Why are we doing that? 25 reps, when it comes to this movement pattern,\nthe most important thing you can do when you’re training your posterior chain is initiate\nwith your glutes. Get your glutes to be the main driver of the\nmovement. Then allow the hamstrings to assist. A lot of us do not have good control over\nour glutes. We have to face facts. So, what we do is take the lighter weight\nto start and really try to establish that mind-muscle connection. Try to establish that purposeful movement,\ninitiating with the glutes, and then squeezing with the hamstrings. We can do that with a lighter weight that\nallows us to get into the movement pattern. Then as we get more comfortable here, we get\nlocked in. Then we want to start adding weight. That’s why we start high and go low, as\nopposed to the other side with the squats. Now, if you were to choose the glute-ham raise\nas your alternative you would still use the same rep scheme, but you’d have to load\nyourself appropriately to do that. To do that you might have to use an assisted\nversion, using your hands to creep yourself up during the first portion of this exercise. Or as you got into the heavier ranges you\nmight want to include some weight held across your chest to allow you to fail in these heavier\nranges. But what is the difference here? The difference is that we’re getting active\nknee flexion here in the glute-ham raise that we’re not getting in the barbell hip thrust. There’s a lot more of an isometric component\nto the knee flexion of the hamstrings in the barbell hip thrust. So, you’re going to feel this more directly\nin your hamstrings when you do this exercise. However, you will also feel this in your glutes\nif you do it right. That’s the driver out of this flexed position. It’s the initiation of the move back to\nthe top by squeezing your cheeks together as hard as possible. And there’s a possibility you might not\neven need to load this exercise as natural fatigue starts to drop your reps considerably\nas you go from your first set to your last. But I will say this: because of the fact that\nyou’re never going to be able to load as much as you can with a barbell hip thrust,\nparticularly through hip extension, if your main goal is training for strength, I would\nopt toward the barbell hip thrust over this alternative. But never overlook the value of this exercise\nas it’s one of my favorites, especially for athletes. Moving on, one of the things I preach all\nthe time as a trainer to athletes is the value of single leg training. You get an additional benefit, especially\nfor athleticism and training single leg that we want to make sure we don’t overlook. It incorporates more hip stability in that\nfrontal plane. As I’ve said, most people overlook that\nvaluable element, opting for all bilateral training. This is one of the things you get from it. So, we do a dumbbell Bulgarian split squat\nin a high-low fashion. What does that mean? It means we can load this more through our\nquads, or we can load it more through our glutes and posterior chain, depending upon\nthe angle of our torso on each repetition. So, if I were to drop straight down, I know\nthat I’ve effectively loaded the quads predominantly on this exercise. Initiating the liftoff from the bottom of\nthis exercise through the quads providing most of the overload there. But if come back up and then the next rep,\nI go down into what we call a sprinter lunge position. That’s immediately loading the posterior\nchain by placing the glutes under enormous stretch. So, what I do is alternate repetitions to\nfailure. So, if I’m doing 12, I have 6 done straight\nup, 6 done bent over, and I’m going to keep that going. Now, when we’re done with these two sets\nthere’s one more thing we want to do before we call it quits and move onto the next exercise. That is a bodyweight plyometric version of\nthis exercise. Why? Because we know two things are going to happen\nhere. Number one: you should always try to speed\nup what you slow down. When you train slow you eventually become\nslow unless you try to become more explosive and deliberate with your movements. This is a great opportunity for us to do that. But second, back in the intro I mentioned\nto you that the different elements of our quadriceps muscles – especially the vastus\nmedialis. Its main role there is for stability of the\nknee, particularly in landing situations. So, what we can do is help that. We can try to train that more effectively\nby including some sort of a jumping exercise. Especially a unilateral jumping exercise like\nthis one, to make sure we’re not overlooking that key function. And again, it allows us to become a little\nmore athletic in our training, which should always be a goal of yours. Speaking of that inside area of the knee,\none of the things that people have mistaken, in terms of training your knee, is that terminal\nknee extension is incredibly important for working or isolating the interior portion\nof your quad. That teardrop vastus medialis. That’s not true, guys. You can’t isolate that area of your quads. However, what you can do is influence its\nability to contract fully, by making sure you go into full extension. What we can do here is do that, not having\nto jump on a leg extension machine to do it. I prefer closed chain environments, where\nmy foot is in contact with the floor. That is how athletes train. So, with this setup here, we have a TK Drop\nlunge. I grab some weights here, I put them in my\nhands, so I have some load, and we can go heavy. What I do is put the band behind my knee and\nI’m resisting. It’s pulling my knee forward. When I get up from that drop lunge and I come\nup to the top I drive my knee back as hard as possible, into full extension. There’s no danger in driving your knee into\nfull extension. There’s a myth about lockout, being some\nsort of damaging component of a joint’s function when it’s a complete function of\na joint. Take it through its full range of motion. Do two to three sets with a 10 to 12 rep max\nin your hands for the drop lunge on each leg, and we continue. Now we get into the other component here where,\nagain, a lot of guy’s workouts would end here, or they would say the rest of it is\nunnecessary. As a physical therapist I will tell you that’s\nnot the case because I say it all the time: all muscles matter. Just because we want to train quads and hamstrings\ndoesn’t mean that’s all we have to train, or all we should be training. We need to train the muscles on the inside\nand outsides of our legs as well. There’s where the adductors come in. This exercise is an incredible way to do this. It’s a dumbbell goblet adductor lunge. What we’re doing is performing a side lunge\nbut look what I’m performing it on. Some sort of a slick surface. Here I have a slick board. You can do this on a floor, on a hardwood\nfloor with your socks on. What you’re trying to do is, when you drop\nstraight down into that side lunge, how are you initiating the return? Don’t just pull it or step it back to the\nmiddle. What you need to do is pull it and slide it\nback to the middle, activating those adductors that we looked in the beginning of this video,\non the inside of your leg. That’s what is driving you up. You’re almost squeezing your legs together\non the floor, as opposed to lifting it. There’s a major difference in terms of the\nrecruitment of the muscles in your legs when you do this. So, I want you to do two sets of 10 to 12\non each leg to make sure we’re hitting these key muscles. Particularly when we know that we overlook\nthese muscles quite frequently. Finally, if we want to burn this thing out,\nwe’ve got to make sure we work on the muscles on the outside. The abductors of the hips. Here’s where this hip-band ladder finisher\ncomes in really, really well. You’re going to hate me for it. I promise you. But what you do is take a band, anchor it\nagainst your arms like I’m showing you, on the outsides of your feet. The key is to not allow your toes to start\ndrifting and turning outward because you start to use muscles as a compensation, rather than\nthe abductors that we’re trying to use here on this hip, by doing it this way. Now, what you do is simply step out in ladder\nfashion. One step to the right, one step back to the\nleft. Two steps out to the right, two steps back\nto the left. Three steps out to the right, three steps\nback to the left. All the way until you reach a ladder of 10. Now you’ll be burning in an incredibly bad\nway by the time you’re done, but it should be a great indication to you of something. There’s not a lot of resistance here and\nyou’re burning like hell. Why is that? Because these muscles are chronically weak. Make sure you add at least one of these. If you want to be psychotic you could add\na second round of this as well, but make sure you don to overlook this. It’s a key aspect of completing the perfect\nleg workout. There you have it, guys. Another perfect workout in the books. As you can see here, all sets, and all the\nreps laid out for you as promised so you can follow along and try this for yourself. I’m telling you, if you haven’t done this\nalready, you’re in for a treat. Or at least you’re going to hate me. And that would be a good thing because you’re\ngoing to feel things you’ve never felt before. You’re going to train like an athlete, you’re\nnot going to overlook any of the muscles that need to be trained here, if we’re going\nto call something a perfect leg workout.
