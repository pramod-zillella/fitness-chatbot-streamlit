    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we're talking how to get bigger legs i'm going to give you some tips that are going to help and they're coming straight from the king of quads jesse lako that's damn rice the king of quads i can't believe i'm saying look this was jesse the one we used to love actually right before the head got as big as the legs and this is actually jesse's legs now he's built bigger legs there's no doubt about it and jesse was the perennial hard gainer who had a real hard time building a leg so what i want to do today is share the tips that jesse has used that have allowed him to build his legs up yep and allow you guys to make the same progress all right so let's start breaking them down one by one all right now the first thing you're going to want to do is something that actually is contrary to one of the belief systems that i grew up on and that was mike menser's heavy duty training jesse doesn't even remember that but what mike mitchell believed in was that if you were following the old workout routines of the bodybuilders 30 and 40 sets two and three hours long the best thing you could probably do is cut back on your training to see better results when it comes to leg training when you're trying to get bigger legs and it's not working for you right now i'm always going to advocate the opposite you actually want to add to what you're doing yeah so that means add a second leg workout to whatever split you're following right now which was i was doing a push-pull legs i added another leg day on the weekend yes and then what about body yeah doing that three days a week and i added again on the weekend an extra leg day right so curtailing the volume a little bit on that last total body day yeah realizing that you're gonna have to accommodate that additional leg workout on the weekend okay so the next thing you're gonna have to do here is to take a leap of faith as jesse did and that is you need to flip the script on your leg training currently look i know that the recommendation you've probably been given is to focus on a lot of heavy squats right and that is an effective method until the the well runs dry right until you need something else and you can't continue to make the gains that you've been making right because you can't keep increasing your strength levels but this is where you have a great opportunity because if you haven't done what i'm going to suggest right now you have an amazing opportunity to stimulate new growth because it's a very new stimulus for your body and that is take those squats that are always heavy and start making them lighter and a lot more grueling delve into the 15 20 and 25 rep ranges and i promise you if those legs haven't grown they're gonna grow every single time yeah that's damn true i can tell you that so on top of that though yep those other exercises that you're doing the lunges bulgarian split squat those that have always been relegated to that end of the dumbbell rack the 15s the 20s the 30s start doing the opposite there so start using the heavier dumbbells to do your bulgarian split squats and the heavier dumbbells or the heavier barbells to do the reverse lunges and i promise you guys the stimulus that you'll get will spark new growth in your legs every single time guaranteed which brings us to tip number three and i think we gotta go back to those lunges again you mean not doing lunges well no doing the lunges because i am a huge fan of lunges particularly for me reverse lunges because they're easier on my knees but if you're not lunging right now and not lunging heavy enough then you are leaving a lot of gains on the table it's true so the benefits that this exercise provides are many if you have any mobility issues at all if you have ankle mobility issues that don't allow you to get deep enough or if you have hip mobility issues you're going to be able to drop that leg back similar to the bulgarian split squat and not have those demands likewise if you have back issues low back pain flexibility issues you're not going to have the same thing here so you are allowed to take away some of those restraints that might be biomechanically holding you back right now and unleash those better gains because you're going to improve your overall mechanics on the move yeah tip number four for getting those stubborn legs to grow is to look to an exercise you may have overlooked many times before maybe even just chose to sit on it and do nothing else well it's a pretty damn comfortable seat if you ask me this is the glute ham raise guys and it's an exercise that you need to start incorporating if you haven't already and you don't need a glute ham raised machine to do this you could actually anchor your feet under a sturdy bench or even a couch at home and get the same benefit the key here is that we're working the posterior chain as it's designed to work leading with a glute contraction to stabilize the pelvis and then allowing the hamstrings to secondarily support that movement it will overload you even with your own body weight and then of course you can what you can load it with weight progress you progressively at that point already uh yes you know take a plate for me right now it's 10 pounds 10 pounds well look the fact is you can overload as you become more comfortable and stronger at the movement but this movement here is one that you cannot overlook anymore and of course nothing is more taxing on your recuperative abilities than a hard leg day and now more hard leg days stacked on top of what we already talked about because you'll be increasing your volume of light training and you'll be increasing your intensity with what i've been showing you here today what that has is ramifications is an impact on your ability to recuperate from those workouts which means you better eat more yep and you better sleep more yep you better eat better yeah jesse my problem i don't eat as well as i should and i don't eat nearly enough so have you given up the gummy bear habit yes actually it's not it's not every single day you replaced it with shake shack okay that's that's not fair i see the bag it says shake shack every day when it comes here the fact is guys one of the things you might struggle with like jessie he has a hard time eating a lot at a given meal that's okay start small increase your meal frequency and just start small so that your stomach doesn't feel like it's too bloated because that's one of your issues right oh my god i feel like i'm going to throw up half the time right but if you over time as you start to adapt to that you'll be able to stun with that and then of course the sleeping part that's been a challenge for you you have all your head injuries what what's the sleeping like uh sleeping is not great i'm uh i'm not very consistent with what time i go to bed or how many times i actually wake up in the middle of the night what's been the biggest thing though that's helped you lately because you have definitely slept better and got better recuperation so what have you been doing there well i've been really really tired from my leg workouts well i mean it's so certain but built-in factor but honestly guys prioritize your sleep i know you said you've been going to bed a little earlier yes so you try to just prioritize yourself if you know you're going to be a restless sleeper throughout the night get in bed a little bit earlier so you can get more of that deep restful sleep across the entire night alright guys so remember if you incorporate the tips and follow in jesse's footsteps here if jesse can do it anybody can do it can i show those legs again yes look at those legs oh they're beautiful man the last time i saw something like that it was sticking out of a nest no the fact is guys there is hope especially for the hard gamers if you got skinny legs incorporate these tips and i promise you they'll work if
