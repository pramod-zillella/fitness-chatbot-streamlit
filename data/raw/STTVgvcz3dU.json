    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today I'm going to show you how to unstick\nyourself in your upper back. If you have this rounded posture or you just\nfeel stiff and you can't really extend through that upper back, you're likely not getting\nenough thoracic extension. I talk all the time about how important and\ncritical that is to performing your big lifts. You can't properly execute a row, or properly\nexecute a front squat, or even do an overhead press, or any other variation of a squat,\nwithout having thoracic extension and the mobility needed through your thoracic spine\nto do them the right way, or you're going to compensate the hell out of them. But how we get here is a little interesting\nbecause we were supposed to do a completely different topic until Jesse showed up to work\ntoday, by the way, because – where were you yesterday? JESSE: I was playing golf. JEFF: Playing golf. On a workday. JESSE: You gave me the day off. JEFF: Okay, playing golf, and he comes in\ntoday, says he feels stiff. JESSE: Yeah. I do. I can't even get my – ah. I can't even get back like that. JEFF: So- JESSE: It's all tight, right up in here. JEFF: Since it's such a common problem here,\nI want to show you guys a way to fix it. There's something I can do to him as a physical\ntherapist, but then something that you can do yourself when you don’t have somebody\nlike me to fix it yourself. It's just going to take a couple of minutes. So, let's take a look at the skeleton first\nso you understand why you're doing what you're doing, and then I'll show you how to do those\ntwo things. To fix this issue, it does benefit you to\nlook beneath the surface to get a clear picture of what's going on so you can attack it the\nright way. There is a very specific way you want to do\nthis. If you look at it, the spine is setup into\nthree zones. We have the cervical spine of the neck, we\nhave the thoracic spine in this area here, and then we have the lumbar spine down the\nlow back. Interestingly, we're trying to just focus\non the middle of that spine – the thoracic area – but it's not the entire thoracic\narea, as you're going to see in a second. We have a couple of curves that happen naturally\nin the spine. Up in the neck you have this curve that's\ncurving inward. As we get to that upper/mid back we have a\nnatural convex curve happening here, and when we get back down toward the low back, we get\nthat natural lower downward curve in here where it curves right back in like it did\nup at the neck. If you look at that, the entire thoracic spine\ndoesn't curve like this. It starts to curve back in as the lumbar spine\ndoes, if you look at a much higher level. You can see it's starting to curve back in\nover here. It's starting to curve back in this direction. So, we don’t want to push anything into\nextension, or regain extension when we already have good extension there. So, it helps us because there are some landmarks\nthat define exactly where you want to focus your efforts. That's the top of your shoulders, which would\nbe the bottom of your cervical spine, and then the bottom of your shoulder blades. That's going to get to the point where it\nstarts to go back into extension again. So, all of your efforts are focused here. So, when you use your foam roller like I'm\ngoing to show you, you can feel the bottom of your shoulder blades, and you know where\nthe top of your shoulders are. The next thing you're going to want to do\nis try to expose this area because if you get your shoulder blades pinched too far back\ntogether, they're going to become more prominent. You can see it here form the side. They're going to become more prominent so\neven if you're trying to push anything in this direction to try and impact the thoracic\nspine here, you're not going to be able to get to it. You want to get these shoulder blades out\nof the way. And we're going to do that. Finally, we don’t always get stuck forward\ninto flexion. We can actually get some rotation there as\nwell. Sometimes when you have that rotation, just\ndoing what I'm going to show you won't necessarily get at it. So, you want to try to get the foam roller,\nand we're going to angle it this way, and angle it this way to try and get at any of\nthese imbalances with flexion and rotation together. But it's really simple, guys. I'm going to do it first on Jesse, and more\nimportantly, I'll show you how you can do it yourself with just a medicine ball and\nfoam roller and get rid of it every, single time. The very easy way to fix this if you have\naccess to a physical therapist or somebody that is skilled in doing this would be to\ndo this manual mobilization. Of course, on Jesse you can see he's pretty\nrounded through here, but what's making it worse is that he's got his arms up under his\nhead. So the first thing you want to do is take\nthem down to your sides. In here. Great. Now he's opening this up and doing the second\nthing we talked about, which was exposing this area a little more. Now I can work right on the thoracic spine. All I'm trying to do is get him to go into\nextension. We can get extension by pushing down. We know to get – if it's already rounded\nthis way, if I push down into that I can get extension. So, what I do is come up on top here. I'm going to have Jesse take a deep breath\nin and as he breathes out, I'm going to push straight down. I'm not going to do it just yet. I'm going to push with the heels of my hands\nin this V-shape here to try and mirror the direction of those transverse processes of\nhis vertebrae. I'm going to push down and in that way. Straight down and in. Down and in. Almost a little bit down and up. You ready? We're going to see if we can hear the pop. Ready? JESSE: *exhales deeply* Oh. JEFF: Yes, we did. Then again. JESSE: *exhales deeply* JEFF: And down. Good. And then one more. Okay, nothing up there. How does it feel? Come on up. JESSE: Way better already. JEFF: See? Already extending better through here. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: So, the idea is that we can get that. More importantly, how the hell do you do this\nyourself? I'm going to show you how to do it step by\nstep. Again, what we just did there was, we took\nthis area where we know we were getting too much rounding and I had those hands placed\nin like this, driving up, down, and up. Just to try and create some extension as I\npressed down and forward. How could you do that if you don’t have\nsomeone's extra set of hands? It's actually not that difficult if you have\na foam roller and a ball. What we do is, the ball has to be substantially\nheavy enough. This is a 40lb med ball. If you don’t have a ball you could use something\nelse. You could even put a bag full of some clothes,\nor even a bag full of sand. Something that's going to provide some weight\nthat you can get your arms around. Ideally, a medicine ball with some weight\nwould be great. Now what you do is take the medicine ball\nand position yourself over the foam roller. Remember, I have my landmarks. I know that the bottom of my shoulder blades\nis right there, as low as I'm going to go, and up into my shoulder height would be as\nhigh as I'm going to go. Anywhere in between is fair game. So, if I take the ball, put it over my chest,\nright on my chest, and wrap my arms around it, again, so we can take our arms into protraction\nand expose the thoracic spine, not having it blocked by the shoulder blades in the back\nlike we showed on the skeleton. Now what I do is balance my feet here and\nI'm going to let the ball come back and over. Obviously, if I had this ball resting right\nhere on the foam roller, when I got to that point the weight would pull it back over the\ntop. What I want to do is get it to do the same\nthing to me. So, I have the ball right on top of my chest\nand then I'm going to let it start to roll this way. As soon as it rolls here, down, like that. You might have heard a little bit of a pop\nin my mid-back. Now I reposition, maybe go a little bit lower,\nto the bottom area of that zone. I have it on my chest, I let it start to roll\nback and down. Good. Then come up a little bit higher. Arms wrapped around, let the ball start to\nroll, and down. Just like that. Now you come up and you have a lot more thoracic\nextensions. You should be free here. If I were to go do a front squat, getting\nin that front rack position would be very easy. If I was going to do an overhead press, maintaining\na tall thoracic spine would be easy. If I was going to do a bent over row, getting\nthe chest out because the thoracic spine is extended would be easy. That's what you need to do. Now, let's pretend – as I mentioned with\nJesse – let's say there's a rotational component, too. You get here, but you still feel a little\nbit stiff. All you have to do is twist the foam roller\nyou're on, still keep your body aligned straight ahead. So, I would still do the same thing with the\nball here, and now I'm working more on one side at an oblique angle. So, I take the same thing, I come back, and\ndown. And I can work up and down. If that doesn’t get it, we can turn it the\nother way and go the other way. I’m still straight here and same deal. Just play with the angle of the foam roller. But I'm going to tell you most of the time\nyou're just going to have to keep it straight across and you're going to notice an immediate\nimprovement. Guys, I hope you've found this video helpful. This is something anybody can do, and this\nis a very common problem. Restrictions into thoracic extension are extremely\ncommon. Especially for lifters. They not only create bad posture, but they\ncreate major limitations when you try to perform the exercises you do in the gym properly. So, you want to make sure you're addressing\nthis. This is an easy way to do that. If you're looking for programs where we put\nthe science back in strength you can find them all over at ATHLEANX.com.
