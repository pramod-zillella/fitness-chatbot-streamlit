    "transcript": "stretching is killing your gains [Music] taking cold showers you might actually be costing your gains cheat meals are killing your gains full range of motion is killing your gains [Music] so in that sense then deadlifts would be killing your gains masturbation is killing your gains oh come on [Music] you know all right i get it i get it i get it i'm just saying so is there anything that's not killing my gains um puppies okay i'm gonna go out and get a puppy then just make sure you don't spend all your time with the puppy because of course you might not go to the gym and then that would be killing your gains and just saying you ruin everything don't you i'm just saying so today the topic is killing gains again is my favorite subject and we're talking about this time the one punch man workout and for those of you that don't know what that is well neither did i join the club but it's a hundred push-ups 100 sit-ups 100 bodyweight squats and a 10k run which is 6.2 miles every single day every day every day and what sparked this was actually i made a video about doing 100 push-ups every single day my opinion wasn't really maybe so favorable for those in the anime community okay so the anime community is like wait a second i don't like what you're saying here about the hundred percent today because it's part of the one punch man workout and they thought maybe i was insinuating that the whole thing was killing your gains actually this guy didn't even insinuate he actually flat out said this is killing your gains is that actually sell well i'll tell you what a workout's a workout why not review it let's take it component by component i'll tell you if there's anything worthwhile i'll tell you what you can maybe could trash let's just get it over with all right so before we get into the exercises specifically can we at least look at the program as a whole again and realize that there is one glaring weakness here one giant hole that if you haven't already seen it then you probably haven't watched my videos often enough and that is there's no posterior chain exercise here there's no pulling exercise in this entire routine and if you're going to perform anything every single day i'd rather you do that than any of these four exercises that being said we can easily fix that by including something as simple as even a little body weight exercise but the point is if you're not doing anything for your pulling muscles you're going to create muscle imbalances and more importantly the health of your shoulders is going to be at risk because you have to keep them balanced if you want to have a highly functioning physique and so with that we jump into the exercises and actually right back into the fire that started this in the first place with the exercise being the push-up now as i mentioned in my stop doing 100 push-ups every day video i want you to do 100 push-ups every day because i don't believe that it's actually effective and why is that because it's likely not challenging you right now 98 of the people watching this video can either do more than 100 push-ups every day or the 100 push-ups is too challenging for you right now and in order to get the most out of that exercise you're going to want to make sure that you're doing either the exercise variation of the push-up that's most challenging to you or that you're doing the volume that's most challenging to you but simply saying for everybody to do 100 is a big problem not to mention on the heels of what i just said before posturally what are we doing we're creating a hell of an imbalance here instead you need to flip over as i recommended there and do something for that posterior chain but if you're gonna do the push-ups without the complimentary antagonistic exercise here then honestly guys it's a waste of time so for the first part of this workout it's a no-go which brings us to the second exercise here and it's 100 sit-ups a day now look i have to say i appreciate the sentiment here of recommending daily ab work because it's something that i've done on this channel many many times before because i do believe in the value and benefits of daily core training that being said i gotta stop short at the limitation to just one exercise and particularly the crunch because the crunch isn't necessarily gonna cut it we know that the abs can function by flexing the spine but they do so much more than that in conjunction with the obliques they actually produce rotation so training that is a good idea they actually prevent movement and prevent rotation so training that is a good idea and again this rotation can happen from the bottom up or the top down and not training those elements is a big mistake too again not training the full function of the abs is a major mistake and also as i mentioned before the push-ups at what point is this going to be too easy for you likely pretty quickly because if you can start banging out many many many crunches at a time it's time to move on to something more difficult in order to keep those gains coming it's no different with the abs guys abs are muscles too you need to continue that progressive overload this right here it's not going to get it done now if there's any exercise in the one punch man workout that's inadequate when it comes to overload it's got to be the squat we know that bodyweight squats are pretty remedial for pretty much every single person watching this video and a hundred of them is something you're gonna probably be able to do almost in one shot within a very quick period of time that being said i do like the fact that the recommendation of an increased volume of legwork throughout the course of a week is what's being recommended here of course not every day but i do think that a lot of times we fall victim to that by actually having our leg day and doing it once a week or once every two weeks or once a month you do train your legs don't you well listen guys you have to make sure again take at least a little bit of tidbit from that increase your leg frequency maybe twice a week again with athlean x we're always going to hit our legs because we train athletically oftentimes on our feet the bottom line is the overload's got to be there though too and of course the bodyweight version of this is not going to provide that which brings us to the last component of the one punch man workout and it's that little tiny 10k run now if that seems a little overwhelming to you join the club however we gotta talk about the merits of running in the first place now i will be the first one to tell you this and this is the true facts here if you want to get ripped and lean running does not have to be part of the equation as a matter of fact cardiovascular activity does not have to be part of the equation it's the truth your diet needs to be on point nutrition will create the abs that you're looking for that being said are you going to ignore cardiovascular training we can't as a strength and conditioning coach i can never ignore the benefits and the importance of cardiovascular training in the overall output of an athlete but as a human being you shouldn't either whether or not you run bike or walk on a treadmill you need to do something to get your heart rate up because your heart is the most important muscle in your body so ignoring it is a big mistake now that being said can you do 6.2 miles right out of the gate likely no i can tell you right now orthopedically that would probably hurt my knees but it doesn't mean that i can't opt for something else like i said maybe a bike ride to do something a little less strenuous less impactful on my joints and you can too but don't ignore the benefits here and work yourself up just like a muscle you can train and increase the volume over time i'm recommending that you do something some form of cardiovascular activity as a matter of fact dr peter attia said that getting yourself into the top two and a half percent vo2 max capacity for your age group decreases your risk of mortality by five times yes guys it's a serious thing it's one you need to consider it's a component of the one punch man workout that i like we just have to kind of build ourselves up to it more gradually and so the big question then becomes is the one punch man workout killing your gains i don't know is it jeff sort of well see as constructed it might be as a matter of fact i actually have a workout within the athletics training system that's called the 400 challenge and it's 100 reps of sit-ups push-ups bodyweight squats and that all-important inverted row to hit the posterior chain that sounds pretty similar to the one punch man workout however it's a challenge it's more of a fitness test you see if you took the one punch man workout and you use it as a guide to determine where you are in terms of your overall fitness right now and then use it as a way to improve upon that in other words how long does it take you in good form to do the one punch man workout because if it took you 20 minutes longer than it took somebody else you can pretty much generalize that your fitness level isn't where it needs to be right now and it can really show some improvement however that being said all those workouts even the 400 challenge is not meant to create the overload that's necessary to take it to the next level that's where you need to step into a program guys if you're looking for a program athlete next has a whole array of them over at fnx.com use your program selector to find the one that's fitted to your goals right now in the meantime found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below what else you want me to cover i'll do my best to do that
