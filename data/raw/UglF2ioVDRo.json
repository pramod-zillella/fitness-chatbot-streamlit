    "transcript": "what's up guys Jesse here just finished uh day two the at the next program Jake's ass guys wow somebody's been working on their delts yeah you know just a little bit here and there what's up guys Jeff Cavalier athletics.com Jesse Lako athenics.com Oh I thought you were maybe the liver King with this look here you mean a little collab well there's two things I don't do Jeff I don't eat liver and I don't eat trying bologna sandwiches wow geez somebody's got something to get off their chest anything else in there uh I have a way better beard jeez well let's talk about you today okay but nobody else you and I want to talk about those delts because we go back five years to this video where we're actually talking about how a hard Gainer which was you built Big deals and I want to be able to help everybody out there who's struggling to build their delts today because as they can see you didn't really have any adults back then no none at all I want to revisit those some of the principles that you were doing in that video because those are actually the exact things that have led to your growth today right and they're the same things I've been doing over and over and over since then and you're gonna make some promises here are you going to help people I promise that this is going to work for you guys you two are going to grow your adults just like me wow big promises Jesse all right well listen if we could do it for him we could do for anybody let's start breaking these down one by one all right so right off the bat guys if you want to build bigger shoulders you're going to have to do some form of overhead pressing this is what Jesse did I started off with dumbbells for me I was not strong enough to lift the bar 45 pounds and you know that's what roughly 22 and a half pounds for per hand right with a dumbbell with the dumbbell so I started off with light dumbbells about 10 15 pounds I mean even in that video you can see when you're doing the press the but the dumbbells are wobbling all over all over the place right so the other thing guys again is proprioception right you have to have that learning curve early on to learn how to actually move those dumbbells in space it could be hidden by the bar I'd actually rather throw him into the fire and have him learn how to move them independently expose any right or left-sided imbalances and just sort of address them all at once and lastly guys when you learn to press the dumbbells it's a little easier to get those elbows out in front of you to protect the shoulders as you build that base and that Foundation strength and guys don't expect huge increases no as a matter of fact you're going to be moving really slow on this one that's more so than any other barbell lift at all especially like the squat and the deadlift yeah we're on like five and ten pounds potentially as you increase you're going to be using maybe two and a half pounds or you're gonna have to be increasing the amount of volume that you're doing to increase your strength on the lift itself guys it's a slow process but it's a rewarding process that's worth every single second of effort you put into it all right so we talked about the push press but it actually is one of the key factors in helping you to build bigger shoulders why when it comes to the push press you're allowed to use more weight and that's because you're using a little bit more momentum from your lower body to get the weight up over a head so when you're stuck especially guys because remember I just told you you're going to get stuck somewhere along the way on a progressive overload and building up your strength on the strict press this gives you a chance to sort of get around that right because you're able to push more weight so when you come back to the strict press you're more comfortable using more weight than you were before control the eccentrics guys on the way down from every rep just again to be able to learn how to handle that weight regardless of how heavy it is and of course make sure you build upon this at every opportunity so you can keep driving up that top end strength all right so now with the shoulder pressing in place and the heavy aspect of your training remember guys like I pointed out a long time ago in that video you still have to focus on the light stuff because even for the skinny guy the light stuff matters a lot tension being the main focus and Driver not necessarily repetitions exactly so when you were doing an exercise like the hip hugger here the goal was again not to count but to do what to make these reps count okay as you always say right so but again what he's talking about is driving up every repetition trying to increase almost that cramping feeling in the delts on the exercise every single time because when I found that I was counting to the Reps that I wanted to you know I would get to that cramping feeling and then I'd stop back off right back off because I wanted to get to the Reps as opposed to going to failure where I knew that I was going to get the most tension and the most gains possible a lot of times beginners are uncomfortable with that discomfort of the rep you want to find a way to seek it out so other exercises that you did it on going back to that old school video one and a half reps yeah one and a half rep side lateral raises and still not really using much heavier weight than you were right now I'm still using lightweight because again I'm trying to focus as much tension as I can into the muscle itself but it feels probably way different than it did today than it did back then right it feels a lot more like I'm doing much more work and feeling much more focus on the delt itself and then we also incorporate finishers you add one that you like because of the continuous tension exactly that's the the play date sequence which is you know play dates into plate raises play press outs and then played overhead presses right so just basically continually going through not letting up on the delts right even though it's burning guys it's the focus here being on driving as much tension into the Dells again forget the rep counts use them only as a guideline for where you want to fail in to know how heavy to load them but for the most part guys stop counting those reps make every one of them count you'll start getting a lot more out of them Just Like Jesse did all right so the next big key particularly for those that can't build their shoulders oftentimes there's a cheat code that you're overlooking and the cheat code is the stretch reflex of a muscle and when it comes to the delts you have to actually intentionally try to do this because the exercises that we do normally don't provide the opportunity to do it so the first thing we did was Target the front delts exactly and the first thing that I did the incline front stretch race right so for the incline stretch phase all you're doing is basically setting the incline up on a bench which takes your arms back into extension at the bottom of every rep naturally right but if you're doing this standing you don't get that same opportunity and the stretch reflex at the bottom of every rep is going to help you to recruit the muscle that you're trying to build when you have a real problem building your shoulders you oftentimes don't have that good connection this actually builds it right into the exercise now if you're working out at a gym you have another option the cable stretch fundraise that's one of my absolute favorites to work my front delts just setting up two cables I like the fact that you're on your feet it's a little bit more athletic but you're getting those arms back behind your body you can see the enormous amount of stretch placed on Jesse's frontel and that's something that you really felt at the bottom of every rep every single rep every single time right so now the side delts we can do the same thing guys you can apply the stretch if you know how to do it yeah I was actually getting my arms out in front of my body this time because it was more comfortable on my shoulder and I was feeling a greater stretch on my delves actually yeah which is not just your middle doubt but you're actually going to get some rear delt stretch here too right and the key thing here guys that while you're doing this you can maximize that stretch by making sure that you don't over rotate right if you just keep going with the arm they're really never creating that differential stretch on the delts right and when we do this guys again we could do it more safely and get better execution to build bigger delts and then we actually have Jesse's secret weapon of all that's not quite a secret because I think everyone should be doing well they're all going to find it out now too you should be training your doubts not just on Delta or push day but also on back day or pull day because your rear delts respond to pulling movements as well so we would talk about an exercise like what uh your favorite the face pull and here of course guys I talk all about the benefits of the exercise not only did it help him to to get better postures one of your fundamental exercises that I made you do all the time to build up his posture but you can see it just gave him overall back development rear delts rhomboids upper back traps the exercise is going to do the same thing for you it's going to give you an overall upper back developer but the rear delts being a key component of that the next thing for pool day was my CD cable row and here tell me why you like it I like it because without using a straight bar I was able to get my hands out wider and able to get my elbows far back behind me to Target my rear delts right so you can flare your elbows out a little bit more but more importantly get your elbows back behind your body when you use a Long Bar so you can get your grip wider out when you use a v handle kind of get stuck up against your midsection here when you get those arms back behind you I told you before many videos it's one of the main drivers of rear delt development when you start to build those rear delves things happen the overall shoulder growth starts to happen and this one was key for you exactly and so no matter how skinny your adults are right now guys I promise you else if you start to incorporate Jesse's plan we'll call it Jesse's plan if you actually want to see that old video that Jesse was in you can watch that one right here if you want to watch this transformation and impressive one at that Jesse you can watch that right over here if you're looking for programs exactly what Jesse uses himself you can find them over at fns.com if you haven't done
