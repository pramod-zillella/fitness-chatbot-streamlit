    "transcript": "JEFF: Off of the pelvis. So we know – oh my God. Raymond's gone. Okay. So he's out. So we know that the pelvis can change position… What's up, guys?! Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Oh, he's back. You knew he'd be back. You can't keep a good man down, especially\nif he's already dead. See, Raymond's back and today he's going to\nhelp us because today we're going to talk all about scapular winging. It's a common problem and it's actually a\ncomplex problem to fix, but it could be a little easier if you take the right step by\nstep approach. We have to do that. What is scapular winging, for those of you\naren't really aware of what it is? It's the position of the shoulder blade in\nrelation to your rib cage, especially as you move your arm. So it's when the shoulder blade wings, or\npushes back this way. If you look at it from the side it's doing\nthis. The insider border is pushing away from your\nribcage. So it's creates this gap that actually looks\nlike a pair of angel wings if someone were to look at you from the back. Well, there's a big problem with this. If you have any movement dysfunction at all\nin your shoulder blades you can assure yourself that you have a movement dysfunction in your\narm and your shoulder as you try to raise it up over your head because you can't raise\nyour arm over your head without having movement of your shoulder blade. I could do that with Jessie right now. If he were to raise his arm up, over his head,\nall the way up he gets to the top only because he's got two thirds of the movement working\nwell here, and one third of the movement working well at his shoulder blades. But if I were to come in here and hold his\nshoulder blade down like this he actually can't raise it beyond that point because I've\nstopped the motion. So we can see right away, if you're not moving\nproperly here you've got big problems. It's a big, common problem to have shoulder\nissues when you're lifting. So what we've got to do is we've got to fix\nthis. So Raymond, thank you. You're back. I'm so happy. If you come here – Jessie, go ahead and\ntake off your shirt. The first thing that you're going to want\nto do is you're going to want to assess your posture and what you look like here as you\nraise your arms up, over your head toward the front of you. So have somebody take an iPhone and film what\nyou look like. You're going to take your arms in front of\nyour body. You see Jessie's gains here. Go ahead and raise all the way up. All the way up. Okay, then come back down. Don’t just drop them. Come down a little bit better than that. So raise them all the way up. Raise them all the way up. Okay, now come on down. Yeah, right there. Stop. Right here you see where this pops off his\nribcage. You can see I can fit my fingers, literally,\nunderneath his shoulder blade here. That is a wing. The medial side here is winging off his ribcage\nthat way. That's the first thing you want to look for\nto see if you get that on the way down. On the way up there's a couple other things\nyou want to look for. First of all, look at the position of his\nshoulders. This one is clearly higher than his right\nshoulder. He's got this up. That's because of the tightness in a muscle\nthat we're going to address here. The second thing was, as he went up he had\na little bit of a head bid there that actually reinforced the fact that I know that this\nlevator scapulae is tight. We're going to want to address that. Then the other thing is, does he get a bunching\nup in here of the rhomboids as he's going this whole motion? You would see that the shoulder blades kind\nof come together and make a crack down the middle. You didn't see as much of that there, but\nif you do then I'm going to show you what to do. So the first thing is, you have to address\nthese via stretches. Jessie, you're going to come right here. You want to address this via stretches because\nif these muscles are tight – we all know that have a winged scapula is going to be\ncaused by a weakness in the serratus anterior muscle. But if that weakness is caused by the fact\nthat the muscles on the opposite side of the serratus are tight, then all the strengthening\nin the world is not going to ultimately fix the problem. You have to stretch the muscles that are causing\nthe problem on the other side of the serratus. So, I mentioned the levator scapula, I mentioned\nthe rhomboids. You could do the two stretches like this. The rhomboid stretch, you're going to put\nyour butt into the wall, Jess, and you're going to take your hands out in front of your\nbody here, and you're going to reach out, keep your butt up, anterior tilted pelvis\nthere, reach, reach, reach, reach, until you feel the shoulder blade stretching out. Okay, he's reaching as far as he can to stretch\nthis out. Get that – just like that. There you go. Now go ahead. One more time. Reach out. Hold, reach. There you go. Like that. So go ahead and turn so they can just see\nwhat you're doing. All the way like this. You're getting this stretched right here,\nin these muscles that pull the shoulder blades here together. The next thing is even better. It's the levator, the thing that's causing\nhim to have all that head nod and things going on. That raising of the higher left shoulder. You're going to stretch it out, you're going\nto look down to the opposite pocket of the side that's tight. So if you have a high left shoulder you're\ngoing to look down toward the right pocket. You put yourself back, up against the wall,\nshoulders back and down, you're looking toward that pocket, use your hand to just reinforce\nand hold it in that position, an then you're going to raise this arm up because the levator\nis a muscle that wants to downwardly rotate the scapula. By going like this we're upwardly rotating\nthe scapula. So we're getting a good stretch on that muscle\nthat's right here. Can you feel it? JESSIE: Yeah. JEFF: Yeah. So we want to make sure that we're stretching\nthis. How many times a day? How often? A couple times a day for a good portion of\ntime. 30 seconds to 60 seconds. Just do it a couple times, but it's more routine\nin terms of doing it regularly throughout the week. It didn't take you one night to get here. It's not going to take you one night to fix\nit. If you don’t have any of those problems\nthe next thing you want to do is assess your posture and standing. Two things: you're looking at the posture\nin the front, and the posture from the side, and you have to look at the posture from the\nother side. You can see that on this side here, even though\nwe've been working a lot with Jessie to try to help fix this, this side is a little bit\nrounded. So it's indicating to me that he's got internal\nrotation here. Or some of the internal rotators are too tight\nthat are causing that. Maybe even a weakness in the external rotators,\nbut subscapularis, number one. Lats, number two. Pec minor, number three. All three stretches I've actually done videos\non how to stretch those out. So to avoid those things becoming 30 minutes\nlong I'll link those in the description below on how to stretch all of those. But you want to stretch those because if those\nmuscles are tight and you're creating this sort of shoulder posture you can mechanically\ncause a weakness in the serratus by impacting the thoracic nerve. The long thoracic nerve. It's a nerve that literally feed the serratus\nanterior. So if that nerve is all screwed up you're\ngoing to get a weakness in the muscle that it connects to. So you could strengthen the serratus all day\nlong, again, like we said before, and do nothing to fix the problem because we haven't fixed\nthe issue that's causing the weakness in the first place. So if you test out and you see that you have\nthis roundedness, or this depression on one side in standing then you have to stretch\nand follow the stretches I've linked below for each of those areas. Let's say you're clear on all of those. You're not tight in any of those muscles that\nI just showed you. Now you want to move onto stretching the serratus\nanterior. In all instances you are going to strengthen\nthe serratus anterior. It's just whether or not you add this group\nof stretches that we just talked about and linked below, or the first two stretches that\nJessie and I did against the wall. So let's go now to the actual exercises themselves. Okay, so if we're going to strengthen the\nserratus – which we need to do – then you need to know what you're doing. You need to make sure that you're protracting\nthe shoulder blade here. It's going to travel around your body as you\nreach forward, but the other thing that it does that we sort of overlook and tend to\nforget is that it upwardly rotates the scapula. So we're going to get that by raising our\narm up over our head. The shoulder blade is going to upwardly rotate. We can actually incorporate that into the\nexercise together with protraction to get a better exercise. The first one we do here is called an apple\npicker. So Jessie's going to have a band wrapped behind\nsomething sturdy, behind him, he's going to raise out in front of him. Now as he's reaching, he's reaching and trying\nto get that protraction here of his arm. The whole time reaching he's going to grab\nan apple from up here and when he brings it, he grabs the apple, now he's bringing it down. He's trying not to let his arm just come down\nand retract here. He's trying to keep it here, keep the protraction\nthere, especially the eccentric contraction as he comes down right there, and he puts\nit right in the basket. Now he reaches back out again. Reach, reach, reach. Push, push, push, push. Don't lean. Don’t lean. Push. There you go. So he's pushing through here to work that\nmuscle. Then he grabs, and then he comes down, and\nhe puts it down inside here. So you work on that higher repetitions, but\nyou do them one repetition at a time. This is better off done as 20 sets of 1, as\nopposed to 1 set of 20. I want quality. You're trying to – it's called neuromuscular\neducation. You're literally trying to reeducate the muscles\nto get them to fire because they've probably been dormant for a long time. Let's look at some more. Next thing we have is a lean back pushup. What you're going to do here is, again, you\nwant to be able to get that protraction, but we're going to force upward rotation here\nof the scapula by having this body change positions. So a pushup plus is good. Let's demonstrate that first, Jessie. Get up, in here. He's going to basically push through his shoulder\nblades. Try to wrap them around his body. He keeps a pretty good position here of his\nlow back. He's trying to push around, but now what we\ncan do is I can have him start to lean back toward his heels. But the goal is push, push, push, push forward,\nforward, forward, as hard as he can. Where do you feel it? Under here? Right there. So he's feeling it in the serratus. You'll feel this immediately if you do this\nyourself. Come back to the front. So again, reset. Remember, always quality reps. Push through, there's the plus, now as he's\nleaning back we're getting elevation because the arm is coming up over the body. But he's pushing and pushing, leaning, and\npushing as hard as he can away from him into the floor, there, and then come back. So you're going to do those as your second\nexercise. So let's move onto the third. Okay, the third exercise is a band pull apart,\nbut you're not looking to squeeze your shoulder blades together as much as you can. You want to work on the eccentric ability\nto keep your arms away from your body as you pull back into the pull apart, okay? So go ahead, and you grab the band, you spread\nit apart there, but the arms are here. Get this posture good here. You are in this protraction here. Jessie's doing the same thing he's done on\nthe floor, and in the other exercises so far. Now pull apart while still trying to keep\nthis relationship – yeah. Put it up top. There you go. Pull, pull, pull. Good. Right there. Now as you reach out, slow, slow, slow, and\nlet it reach, and reach, and reach. Okay, now pull apart. Keeping it here. Okay, just like that. You want the control without – now go ahead\nand show them, pinch your shoulder blades together. From here, go ahead. Do a regular one. Go ahead. Just pull apart. There you go. That's what most people are doing. We're not looking for that in this exercise. That's a different exercise meant to strengthen\nthe rhomboids. What we're trying to do here is work on the\nserratus and you do that the way I just showed you. Okay, next up is the wall screw. This one here is going to give us a chance\nto protract into a wall. It's a good beginner exercise. Get your hands here, the screw part comes\nin a second, but the key, again, when we do these exercises, it's not to – let's show\nthem the wrong way. It's not to just round out the thoracic spine\nbecause sure, we're getting some protraction here, but really we're getting a lot of compensation\nhere through our spine, which is not what we're looking for. So you get back in this position. Now once you're here you keep this nice and\nstraight. The protraction is going to be just like that. So we're isolating the serratus activity there\nand we get into the punch. Go ahead. Now from here, we screw our arms this way\ninto external rotation. Just like that. Good. And then come out and reset. So here, push like that. Yep. No. watch that thoracic spine. There you go. Then screw. Go screw, Jessie. I love being able to tell Jessie to go screw\nhimself. Here, down, and reset. All right, so another good option – again,\nno excuses here because everybody's got a wall. It's just making sure that you're doing it\nthe right way. That's what is going to help you in the long\nrun. Okay, next one. This is, again, a more advanced version, after\nyou have the control and reawaken this muscle. You still need to make sure that it's staying\nstrong, especially compared to all the big muscles that you're working on in your body\nall the time. So we want to make sure we get the protraction\nwhere you do. This is a dip plus. So you get into a dip position. So with Jessie in his dip position now, he's\npretty much straight up, right? So we're not going to get much protraction\nhere. Raise this just a tad when you're up there. He's not going to get much protraction unless\nhe leans forward. So he leans forward – his whole body – keeps\nthese locked out, now he's goes into the protraction of his shoulders. Just like that. He lifts up into a plus. All he's doing here is holding for an isometric\nhold of about five seconds, to ten seconds. However much he can withstand. You're going to get your abs working here,\ntoo. we call this exercise at the gym, it's abs\nbefore, but the real focus here is to push through the shoulders and not just lifting\nup through the abs. okay, do a couple more. Just like that, and you're holding there. We have one more exercise. The straight arm pushdown. I'm going to show you how to do that and we'll\nwrap this all up. All right, finally we have that second overload\nexercise. Remember, it falls in line after you've already\nbuild up that mind-muscle connection in the dormant serratus. It's the straight arm pushdown. You can do it to work the serratus by tweaking\nthe way you do the exercise. Get in this position here. You're setup with a good position here of\nthe thoracic spine. You're not rounding it forward. From here it's just a small movement of the\nprotraction just like that on the scapula to isolate the serratus. Now we load up the weight that allows us to\ndo the straight arm pushdown. Come back up to the top, reset, up nice and\ntall. Good. Just the protraction there and he's able to\nload up the weight heavier than he does on the other exercises. Remember, this is one of the exercises that\ncomes in, as I said, after you've already built it up. So remember the progression here. Identify first if you have any of those tightness's. The ones in the opposing muscle groups. The ones that oppose the serratus. If they're tight they could be causing weakness\nin the serratus and you're never going to fix that unless you stretch those first. The other muscle groups that cause internal\nrotation and literally cause a physical impingement on the nerve itself. Unless you fix that and take the impingement\noff the nerve you're never going to address the weakness in the serratus. Once you get to the point where you're doing\nexercises to strengthen the serratus you have lots at your disposal here, work your way\nup. Choose a few. Make sure that you're routinely doing them\nbecause it didn't take you just a day or two to get weak and to cause this situation in\nthe first place. It's not going to take you a day to fix it. All right, guys. I hope you've found this video helpful. In the meantime, if you're looking for a program\nthat puts the science back in strength, realizes that we're all going to have to use our shoulder\nat some point unless we just sit here and go like this all day with a remote control;\nhead to ATHLEANX.com and get our ATHLEANX training program. Again, let me know what you want to see here\nin future videos and I'll do my best to cover it for you in the days and weeks ahead. See you."
