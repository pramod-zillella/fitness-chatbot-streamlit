    "transcript": "i used to work out a lot with weights and the check comes doing that your joints start to hurt this back knees it just happens uh sometimes getting in that kind of shape can kill you there's fantastic trainers like jeff cavalier on ethelenex his videos are amazing but at my age i found the hardest toughest most productive way is bands training with bands what's up guys jeff cavaliere athletics.com just as sly said himself resistance bands can be an incredibly effective training tool if you know how to use them today we're going to continue our popular series of band training this time to help you build bigger legs with that being said oh my lord whoa whoa whoa coming from back behind the camera you say legs that's my cue king of quads what's up [Music] okay quads where's tom platts well you've heard of coke and diet coke right yes i had well you got tom platts and diet tom platts so if you don't mind i would like to get to demonstrating some of these exercises with my beautiful legs and even better my beautiful shorts if you don't mind i like to explain the exercises because that's something you don't know anything about well how about you explain them i demonstrate them sounds good yeah okay so all we're doing is keeping them waiting at this point so first exercise up is at what point did i actually lose control of this channel that's what i'd like to know all right so let's talk about the first exercise up here but before we do i think it's important to talk about a caveat about band training for those out there who think i can't build muscle with bands yes you can realize that bands are not a replacement for or a substitute for the other types of training they're a complement to a properly performed training program and we can see that we can actually take exercises that you're already doing right now utilize bands and improve the ability of that exercise to stimulate muscle growth because we're introducing new stress at different points in the range of motion as we manipulate the strength curves so if you look at the first exercise up here it's the banded reverse lunge we all know the benefits of a reverse lunge in terms of being a great solid leg exercise but by applying the band around our waist and performing it as i'm doing here importantly by starting in this stepped out resisted position we finish in that stepped out resistant position what that means is we're actually applying resistance to leg extension and making those quads work as we get to the top of every single one of these repetitions a lot of times people place the band around their waist and then lunge out against the resistance of the band but all that does is actually pull you back to the starting position taking away some of the work from the quads this is not doing that you have to overcome the resistance of the band and therefore it makes a good exercise or one of my favorite exercises even better and that brings me to the next exercise here is the banded pistol squat and one thing that bands can do here is actually allow you to do an exercise that may actually be too difficult for you to do right now so we go back again to that idea that bands can't actually help you build muscle this is taking an exercise that oftentimes is too hard for people it's a great way to overload but because it's too hard you can't even do it well bands will actually allow you to assist the move so with the pistol squat i'm actually able to manipulate how much tension i have or assistance i have to get me through that repetition you can either wrap it up a little bit tighter around your hands for more assistance or sort of let up on the reins a little bit for less assistance either way applying overload in the form of a single leg squat which can be particularly helpful especially for those that are dealing with muscle imbalances or simply just never do single leg versions of squats exercise number three here proves it's not all about jesse's infatuation with the king of quads we also have the other side of our body here the posterior chain and this exercise does an amazing job of hitting them both at the same time we're talking about the banded bridge and curl and what i like to see here is that you anchor the bands around your ankles and back up away from the anchor point now when you pull your heels in towards your butt you're obviously activating the hamstrings through knee flexion but we can take it a step further an important step further by bridging because we know that through the bridge we can get glued activation at the same time we have that activation of the hamstrings and that is how you want to train them if you can train your hamstrings and glutes to work together as they prefer to you not only have a better exercise option here that's perfectly suited here to bands but one that's going to fortify you against injuries like hamstring strains and hip strains and speaking of the posterior chain exercise number four is another exercise that gives us a chance to hit both the hamstrings and the glutes at the same time and we're talking about the banded step through you hang the band up here on the pull-up bar and you're stepping down and through trying to get that leg into full extension back behind your body because we know we can get good full glute activation by doing so this is an exercise that i had wwe superstar drew mcintyre do when he was here obviously different dimensions in size than jessie demonstrating but you get the point the exercises the exercise and the muscles and benefits are the same exercise number five takes another one of my favorite exercises and applies a different twist to it because of the utilization of the band it's the bulgarian split squat you can see that you can perform this exercise the same way except this time utilizing the bands instead of weights but what that does is it introduces a different resistance curve right we know that as we get to the top of the exercise we have the most resistance where with the dumbbells we'd actually start to peter out as we got towards the top so this is the case where i would love to see somebody have both the band and dumbbells in their hands to create those overlapping strength curves but again even just the utilization of the band is enough to provide a different stimulus on a great exercise and therefore give you a great option for building your legs and that brings us to the next two exercises here in the list and these are going to both focus on terminal knee extension meaning the leg extension without doing a leg extension and we still get benefits here as a matter of fact i think better benefits because we're doing these in a closed chain style so i'm talking about there's a tke split squat drop so closed chain meaning you have your feet in contact with the ground throughout which provides a more normal ground reaction force to stimulate the kinetic chain as it should be as opposed to some open-ended machine based leg extension now what we get is the ability to still resist that knee extension note at the top of the exercise as you come to the top you pull back against the resistance to that bam really creating that same leg extension feel and that quad contraction in addition to the benefits of the traditional split squat as well i've used this with a lot of my athletes here it's one of the best ways to overload that last little bit of leg extension and build up those quads which brings us to exercise number seven that other exercise for leg extension this is called a banded leg extension and though this can't mimic the same overload that you would get from let's say 125 pound leg extension is resisting the extension in that final 20 or 30 degrees you wrap the band around the back of your legs and allow it to bend your knees forward all you have to do again close chain feet in contact with the ground is simply drive your knees back against the resistance of that band if you have never tried this before do so i promise you an intense quad contraction and one that you'll see will benefit you particularly if you gave up doing leg extensions a long time ago because they hurt your knees and that brings us to exercise number eight when we're talking about building your legs it's not just about quads and or even glutes and hamstrings but about everything in your lower body and we're talking about the hips here as well and the banded frog press is one of the best ways to hit those often overlooked hip rotators so what you do is you double up the band like jesse's doing here you wrap it around your knees you lay back on the floor feet together and rest the outsides of your feet on the ground you're going to simply bridge up and down from here but holding out isometrically against the resistance of the band to get those hip external rotators firing the combination of the press from this position and the resisted iso from this position are enough to create an immense overload on muscle groups that are oftentimes just simply overlooked not anymore if you start incorporating this we know that one of the main functions of the hamstrings is not just to bend the knee but it's also to assist in hip extension and we can get that here with the single leg rdl performed with the band and i'm not so concerned here about having you maintain your balance on the exercise so it's okay as jesse's doing here to put your foot back behind you as almost a little bit of a kickstand for balance control however as you drive yourself to the top you want to drive your butt forward against the resistance of the band which is going to activate not just your hamstrings but your glutes as well keeping your knee a little bit more straight here will shift the load primarily to the hamstrings allowing the knee to bend a little bit more will shift the load a little bit more posteriorly to the glutes either way it's a great posterior chain exercise and one that's going to provide you benefits if you're looking for one with bands exercise number 10 here is actually worth the price of admission this is called the reverse leg press you can see it actually looks just like you're performing a leg press in reverse so what you're doing is you're hanging that band high up on a pull-up bar and not just pulling it in with your heels but pulling down and in as i mentioned before training the glutes and the hamstrings at any time at the same time is always gonna be the best way to do it this reverse leg press is one you're gonna have to try and that brings us to one of my favorite unilateral exercises here perform with anything either dumbbells or in this case bands and it's the step up and we can get the benefits of this exercise and actually tweak them once again because the resistance curve of the bands provides a different stimulus and what we do is as we step up we're stretching that band with every inch we get up towards full extension so we're maxing out the resistance of the band at the very top of the lift when we hold dumbbells we're changing it up a little bit it's hardest if we start to initiate the move from that bent knee again bands introducing a different stimulus here that oftentimes is just enough to allow you an opportunity for overload simply because you're doing something you've never done before so how'd i do i i mean well also i noticed that you said during the demonstrations i i you know i did this i did that you didn't do  that was all me by the way what do you think of my shorts okay you can get out of here you and your shorts out right now guys listen no i didn't do anything in this video but i'm providing you with the tools now that you can do it if you're looking for exercises guys a complete program now we actually have one called athlean elastics available over at atlantis.com a complete band only training program if you like this video and
