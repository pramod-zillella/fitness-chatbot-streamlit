    "description": "Do you have bad posture and wish you could do something to fix it? Then this is an important video to help guide you through the ...",
    "transcript": "[Music] what's up guys if cavalier athletenext.com do you have something wrong with your posture right either your head is forward or your shoulders are slumped or your pelvis is tilted but just something's not right look even our own posturally challenged jesse has been there done that hey recovery recovering posture deficient person jesse look you don't have to live this way the fact is though we have a lot of things that can fix your problem or six less after you watch this video because not everything promoted as a posture fix is actually going to do anything to fix your posture if anything it could actually make it worse so let's identify what those problems are so that you never fall from the member again and more importantly we get you on the right track to fixing your posture once and for all all right so can we talk about that sitting on a physio ball thing again right you probably have seen this before it's not going to do anything to help correct your posture for more than let's say 45 seconds you see while it does give you the bio feedback to be able to get into that nice upright position there is no back support there is no additional stability so anything that you're lacking currently like let's say muscle endurance and all the muscles up and down the back is going to be challenged here rather quickly so while it might put you in the right position it will do nothing to keep you there and more importantly guys now because you're on an unstable surface you're just going to introduce more instability from below the pelvis can shift left and right the pelvis can rock forward and back you're lacking everything that it is you need to maintain this so all it's really doing is making weak muscles become more fatigued faster not really a posture fix all right so now let's jump from the frying pan into the fire and go from bad to worse have you ever seen one of these things you know those posture braces all over instagram well guess what they don't work you see if you're wearing a brace to put you in the right posture it's sort of like the equivalent of me putting jesse and a full nelson here to get him to have his shoulders back hey buddy you want me help you get your shoulders back yeah absolutely great just like this yeah you're good it's not going to do anything long term if you want to get your posture fixed you better strengthen the muscles you don't just put something on there to hold you in the right posture what makes this particularly irritating is that these products are so bad that they actually have to use jessie and i to try to help sell their products so they just put us into their ads without even asking for permission look forget these things guys if you ever find yourself on a web page like this and you're thinking about spending your money you're probably better off just taking it and i don't know maybe driving to a bridge and throwing it off the bridge at least you get some entertainment watching your bills float down into the water which brings us to posture fix number three you ever see this one guys you don't look for these things that continue to try to just remind you about when you're doing something wrong that's like a doctor telling you hey you gotta quit smoking a reminder doesn't do anything actually quitting smoking might actually get you to the point where you're getting healthier all right hold on now before you get on me for this one let me explain myself you see i have an enormous amount of respect for the practice of yoga not just doing a little bit of yoga each day you see because yoga as a practice can deliver amazing benefits when it comes to fixing your posture because we know it increases your flexibility we know that it increases your mobility we know that most of all it could increase your endurance in all of these positions that we're lacking with all these quick fixes however if you approach your yoga practice as a quick fix you're not getting anything out of it jesse here just doing a few half-assed poses most of which aren't even done right are not going to do anything to help correct any posture problems he has and he thinks just because he's doing yoga that that's going to help them no don't make the same mistake if you're going to do yoga practice it be intentioned with it have a purpose with it and there you'll find your long-term benefits all right so the next one is also a hot thing right now a lot of us have made the switch to go from our sitting desk to our standing desk and somehow that's going to fix all of our problems actually i think it's going to introduce a lot more problems than actually sitting down is because when we're talking about postural problems and the muscular pains that can sometimes be associated with them you're actually getting an aggravation of muscular driven postural pain and standing rather than sitting now if it's disc related problems sitting is always going to be the more aggravating position but when we're standing the reason why we have more susceptibility here is because there's more stuff we can do wrong you see just because we're standing doesn't mean that we can't assume bad postures we can't stand on one leg or cross one leg over dropping our pelvis on one side or lean forward even from a standing position all these things are still possible and not corrected by a simple act of us just standing up if you want to do something better for your posture when you do stand from your chair walk around a little bit stretch out hold on to a pull-up bar decompress a little bit but don't just think that standing alone is going to fix all your problems and last but certainly not least because of how prevalent this one is we're talking about the foam roller now look again i like the foam roller but just like yoga if you're gonna just screw around with it i always say it's like a monkey [ __ ] a football if that's the approach you're gonna take to the foam roller then do me a favor don't use it at all because you can do more damage with this than benefit if you don't know what you're doing if you were to let's say roll out your lumbar spine it's a bad idea it's going to cause more back problems than it's going to solve if you're going to try to increase your thoracic extension and you decide to roll out in this direction that's not going to do anything if you want to increase your thoracic extension in the sagittal plane then you better turn that roller sideways and roll over it like this the fact is how you roll when you roll what muscles you're rolling the direction you're rolling in and how long you're doing it all matters here it's not just let's go have some fun with the foam roller on the floor all right so look guys if you're trying to fix your posture we know that these aren't the ways to do it if you want to fix your posture long term you're going to have to put some work in and like i said it didn't take you five minutes to get in this position so expect to put in more than five minutes to undo the problems you've caused that being said guys i put together a whole video for you it's called how to fix your posture in four moves whether or not it's the nerd neck forward head position whether it's the rounded shoulders or the pelvic tilt i've got you covered here i want you to make sure you watch that video if you're looking for programs where we actually incorporate posture correction into all the workouts we do because it matters as a physical therapist you can't look at one thing in
