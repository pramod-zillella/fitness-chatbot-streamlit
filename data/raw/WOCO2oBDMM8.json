    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today I've got a brand new bicep workout for you that I want you to try because I want to convince you that you either train harder you train long but you can't do both the volume Warriors are gonna see once and for all that when you up the effort level you don't need to go so long and I want to convince you of that by having you do this exact workout now what are we doing here well first of all I'm a little out of breath because I didn't want to wait to film this portion of the video after just doing this workout I was pretty much laid out I want you guys to feel experienced the same thing so not a moan I'm just going to come back and narrate what I did but I'm actually gonna do it in real time like we're at an instant replay that we can look on together alright so let's start looking right into this workout there's two combinations here one that I'm giving you three minutes to perform between two exercises and the next one that you get three minutes to perform so six total minutes is all it's going to take so if you look at the first combination here I'm starting sitting down for me that's a little bit of an oddity is it someone that likes to Train athletically I'll usually like to be on my feet but there's a purpose for doing your barbell curls seated and that is number one we're limiting the bottom range of motion here for a purpose I'm gonna get to that in a second first though look at what happens when I do this I actually eliminate that bottom 20 degrees from the curl and it's in that bottom 20 degrees that most of the initiation of a cheat would occur because that's where the sticking point is and we tend to lean and cheat to get through that but now even though I reached failure I stand right up and I keep going because mechanically I know that now with a little bit of that forward lean and backward lean I'm able to get a little bit more out of my biceps so I take that first exercise here and I do it in a drop set fashion with whatever weight I have now for me this is a fairly light weight I'm used to curling 150 pounds this is life for me but for you it might be something different but the idea is go sub maximally here in terms of the weight the effort level will equalize this for me so now I strip it out and I go back down to now just one plate on each side now this is the second benefit of this by doing the seated down version here the curl by taking out that first 20 degrees of the curl I'm also increasing the contribution of the brachioradialis and the brachioradialis is more inclined to trying to initiate the curl in the bottom because it's distal to the biceps it acts first and then when the biceps get added more of a mechanical advantage to contribute they take over and do most of the curls so by doing this their exercise this way I am favoring more bicep contribution which is what we're trying to do and I'm doing it in the stronger portion of the exercise when I'm most fresh only when I fail do I drop to the second portion here which is standing and I try to rip out a few additional reps done this way with the additional contribution in the brachioradialis to help me through that sticking point okay now I strip it one more time it's just a barbell light weights but light weights at this point feel really damn heavy remember guys your muscles cannot read the number on the side of a plate or a barbell or a dumbbell all they do is know the tension that's being applied to them at the moment that you're lifting them and the tension right here is pretty damn high as you can see those biceps are about ready to pop so now I finished this first version here of this drop set the last set here I come back up again and now I got a rep out one more time up here at the top I mean at this point I'm praying for every new rep that I get two and a half maybe three I don't know if I call that three yeah it was two and a half and a dud of a fourth rep but I've reached failure now so now that's the first half here now we move to a second component and that was all under three minutes and I'm already wasted I would give you a few minutes here to recuperate but now we got to take it to the next stage and the next stage here is going to be right here up against the wall and this here is a strip curl and when you do the strip curl there's three points of contact that must stay in contact with the wall it's the back of your head the back of your of your upper back and your butt your arms can come away from the wall your feet stay planted but those three points to contact as you can see here must remain in contact with the wall at all times now again this is lighter than what I would use for a curl but done in this format when I can't generate any extra momentum I'm using a lighter weight but it's no less difficult for me especially given the second position here and the line up to that first exercise combination when I reach failure I step away from the wall same principle now and I go and I perform a few cheat reps and again I'm getting more elbow extension here not being blocked by the wall this is extremely difficult the idea here is push yourself these are not fake faces guys I make these faces a lot because it actually is the ugly face I make when I train because the effort level is high you shouldn't be able to train with a straight face you should have some form of an ugly face to convince yourself that you're actually trying your hardest now I strip one time again just like I did in the last exercise combo and I'll back up against the wall again and again I want you to take this to failure you can see here guys I'm practically exploding but the effort levels high again trying to keep those points of contact there that heads just about an inch or so away from the wall trying to keep it up there it's difficult and I come around the front again maybe got another rep or so up that head came down see your body knows how to cheat don't let it now I step away from the wall and now I'm using a little bit of momentum and I continue trying to get a last couple reps come on so there I go I get failure now I got one more shot one more shot I strip I put on back just a 10 some might accuse me of a slow strip here just to buy a little extra time it could be right now I need to put that last time back on clip it in back up against the wall and one more round again you can see a little bit of a preview a range of motion there because of the elbows up against the wall will limit that bottom portion but it has the same effect here limit a little bit of that brachioradialis taking over and being the fatiguing factor I want my biceps to do the work I come back around the front here a few more repetitions fighting for every single and this is my last set my sixth combo of six getting in here under three minutes for this segment and under a total time limit of six minutes total and now I'm out here repping out one more time to failure couple deep breaths last one maybe one more and done and wasted so guys the idea is six minutes can give you an effective workout if you're willing to up your intensity level I put out a previous workout series to soar and six if you didn't try that there's another bit of evidence there to convince you that you actually can do this if you're willing to train harder I implore that you do guys your best results are always going to be on the other side of higher effort not necessarily on the other side of pure junk volume if you're looking for a program that does understand this and trades in unnecessary volume for intensity at every opportunity make sure you head to athleanx.com to check out our programs if you
