    "transcript": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com. \nToday, the long awaited conclusion to the   perfect PPL series, Push, Pull, Legs \ntoday is the perfect leg workout.\n  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, \nwhoa, whoa. You rang?\n  No, actually, no. \nWell, you call perfect leg workout,   so you might as well just said, \"Hey, Jesse.\"\nOh, is that what we're calling you now?\n  Oh, yeah. You know why? Because not \nonly do I have very impressive legs,   I also am the advanced powerlifting, \nbut that's for another video.   And not only that, I'm wearing my \nshort shorts, which is, you know,   they say thighway to the danger zone. Short \nshorts are not something you ever wear.\n  Well, I've got my uniform, but I'll tell \nyou what, speaking of shorts this is a   good idea. We actually have the Athlean-X Shorts \nChannel, that if you don't know about it already,   it's Athlean-X in 60 seconds or less and \nyou want to make sure you subscribe to that.   It's also a place where you can see Jeff \nCavalier in shorts, right here like this. So,   I would argue, Jesse, I might be more qualified \nthan you after looking at that picture. \n  Maybe. But still, I have--\nDon't worry about it, I'm going   to give you a shot. \nYeah? \n  You want to be in the video?\nHallelujah. \n  You can shoot the exercises.\nYes. So, guys, if you like me doing the   workouts, leave your comment below. If you don't \nlike doing the workouts, leave your hatred.\n  Leave the hate below. \nOh, come on.\n  All right guys, I'm going to break it down \nfor you here, the perfect leg workout,   exercise by exercise. Let's get it started. \nSo, let's dive right into it, guys and if you're   new to the perfect PPL series here, the push, \npull the legs. How is this going to all set up?   What are you supposed to do day by day? Guys, \nI've got you covered. As I referenced in both   the pull and the push workouts, which, by the way, \nare going to be linked at the end of this video,   we have a specific recommendations on how \nyou structure these workouts. The first is   to do it in a sequence of pull, then push and \nthen legs. And as I mentioned in those videos,   you have an option to either do them again \nright away as six continuous days of training   with the off day coming always on that seventh \nday. That's called a synchronous split. But I   think you can run into some issues with recovery \nwhen the pull and leg workouts run back-to-back.   Or to do what I've been recommending strongly, and \nthat is to put an off day after every three days   of training. And with what we're doing on this leg \nday, it's important that we get an extra day of   rest, a buffer between this and the subsequent \npull day. Now regards to how this leg workout   relates to the other perfect leg workout we have \non this channel. These are not interchangeable.   That was part of our one-off series for guys are \nfollowing more of a bro split with less frequency,   a longer time to get through each of those \nmuscle groups, with more volume built in for that   purpose. Here again, it's relating to the other \nworkouts that we're doing in this PPL split. So,   make sure that when you do this, you're \nfollowing this version of the leg workout. \n  All right, so let's start breaking down \nthis workout exercise by exercising,   so you know exactly what you have to do. And \nas all these workouts here in this PPL split,   we're looking for hypertrophy as our main goal. \nBut it doesn't change the fact that the number   one exercise that you should expect to see here, \nand you will see here is the Barbell Squat. And   we're going to perform this as four sets of four \nto six. Now you're going to leave one or two reps   in the tank. However, we still want to focus here \non progressively increasing our strength in the   exercise. What that means is choosing a weight \nand adapting that weight as necessary to ensure   that you fall within that four to six rep range, \nreserving those last couple reps. If you need to,   if you start to see that you're getting up into \nseven or eight or nine range, you're going to   need to add weight and subsequent workouts to \nensure that you continue to get stronger.\n  We know that even when seeking out hypertrophy \noverload, intention overload is a great mechanism   for doing that. We then move on to the next \nexercise and this here I'm going to use   the Barbell Hip Thrust as my choice. Now, \nthere are a lot of good options here,   namely the barbell RDL. But again, realizing that \nthis is part of an overall split and that we're   deadlifting very soon after this, whether you're \nfollowing the synchronous or asynchronous split, I   want to give my lower back a little bit of relief \nhere so I can do it with the Barbell Hip Thrusts.   And what we're doing is we're still targeting the \nposterior chain. We're still trying to develop   the hamstrings and glutes and really drive them \ntogether, letting the glutes lead the way. But we   don't have to do it in a way where we're leaning \nover and necessarily compromising our low back or   fatiguing it more than we have to. We're going \nfor three sets of eight to 10 reps here, again,   targeting the posterior chain without allowing it \nto drift a little bit too high into the low back.   Which brings us now into the third exercise. And \nthis year I like to go back to the anterior chain   with one of my favorite all time exercises, and \nit's the Dumbbell or Barbell Reverse Lunge.\n  So, we do this with a step backwards. And \nthe beauty of the step backwards is it takes   some of the anterior shear forces away from the \nknee. And for people that are either chronically   dealing with knee pain or are acutely dealing with \nsome knee pain, this gives everyone the chance   to get the benefits of the exercise without \nany of the negative side effects that you   might be experiencing right now with \nit. Now, the lunge to me is one of the   more athletic exercises you can do. We need to \nget ourselves into that split stance position   at some point in our workout, if we want \nto train our legs in a more functional way.   You're going to go for two to three sets \nof 10 to 12 repetitions each leg. \n  Which brings us to the fourth exercise here in \nthe workout. And this is our first RW, which   that means is it's a Rotate With. So, although \nthere's primarily one version of this workout,   this in the next exercise are going to have an \nexercise that you should rotate every other time   you do the workout. So, the first time through \nyou're going to do the Dumbbell Single Leg ADL,   you're going to rotate the next time with the \nSlick Floor Bridge Curl. But let's talk about   the RDL first. I mentioned how much I liked the \nexercise and how it was a possible candidate   for the number two spot here, but I wanted to \noffset some of that load on the low back.\n  Well, this Dumbbell Single Leg version here is \na great way to do that without having to forgo   the exercise entirely. We have the opportunity \nto lift one leg up behind us as we go down,   which helps to keep the low back flat and \neases any of the stress that we might have or   additional fatigue we might get in that area. And \nwe know that the Single Leg RDL is a great way to   eccentrically train the hamstring and again, drive \nit with the glutes to allow for some additional   hypertrophy of these important, most irritating \nmuscles. Two to three sets of 10 to 12 repetitions   for each leg. And then we had the Slick Floor \nBridge Curl, which is one of those devious and   sort of downright horrible exercises that does a \ngreat job of overloading the glutes and hamstrings   and working them together. You simply get on the \nfloor in any environment where you can drag your   feet on the floor, so socks on a hardwood floor \nworks great. Get up into that high bridge, allow   your legs to essentially lengthen the hamstrings \nwill really start to light up. But don't let   the hips drop. Try your best to keep the hips as \nhigh as possible by engaging the glutes and then   pulling in and doing the Hamstring Curl.\nAnd the beauty here is this is basically   a better version of a Hamstring Curl. We know \nthe Hamstring Curl can create good hypertrophy in   the hamstrings as you're overloading deflection. \nHowever, this is a closed chain environment with   the feet and contact with the floor, as opposed to \ndoing this when you're lying face down on a bench   which can sometimes introduce low back problems \nby overworking the hip flexors into the bench.   And that brings us to our last exercise here. \nWe're going to round out the perfect leg workout   with a little bit of calf work. And again, this is \nanother one of those RW or Rotate With exercises.   You're going to do the Standing Dumbbell \nCalf Raise or the Seated Dumbbell Calf Raise.   And the difference here is the position of the \nknee. With the knee held straight, you're going   to be overloading more of the gastroc and with \nthe knee bent, you're going to be overloading   the underlying soleus. Now, here you have the \noption of doing this either two legs at a time   or if time allows, I always think people can \nget a little bit more out of it if they can   do it one leg at a time. The point is really \ntrying to squeeze each and every repetition,   go for the good contraction here, don't just \nswing the weight around or bounce up and down.\n  It's when you go for the focus tension \nthat the hypertrophy gains are the best.   To round this out guys, you're doing three sets \nof 15 to 20 repetitions done on each leg or done   simultaneously. \nHow's it feels. \n  Oh, feels great. I mean my legs are burning.\nI was talking about actually getting a shot   to shine in front of the YouTube audience. \nOh, I always loved being in front of them. \n  All right. So, guys, there you have it. The \nperfect leg worked out. I'm going to put it up   here as I always do. Take your screenshots, put it \ntogether with the perfect push and pull portions   of the PPL split. I'm going to actually link \nthose at the end of this video. Also, if you're   looking for step-by-step plans, guys that include \nnutrition step-by-step as well, you can find them   over at athleanx.com.
