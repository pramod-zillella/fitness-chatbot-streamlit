    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. The pushup is by far one of the most classic\nexercises of all time, but it's also the one exercise with probably the most variations\nof any other exercise. Today I'm going to cover 33 of those from\nbeginner, to intermediate, to advanced with the idea being this: find the version that\nchallenges you. If you're still doing the same, old, classic\npushup because that's what you're good at then you're not going to be challenging your\nbody to get any stronger, any better, any different than it is today. Find the version that challenges you and let's\nget this thing done. So there you have it, guys. 33 pushups. Lots to pick from. No excuses, right? The bottom line is this: the way you do the\npushup can challenge you in many, many different ways. You can work on your power. You can work on your strength. You can work on your coordination. You can work on your endurance. There are many, many ways to work a pushup\ninto your routine. It's choosing the right one and knowing how\nto challenge yourself with it. If you're looking for a program that puts\nit all together, that challenges you at the right time and makes sure that you're never\ngetting complacent with where you are right now; then head to ATHLEANX.com and get our\nATHLEANX training system. In the meantime, if you've found this video\nhelpful, leave your comments and thumbs up below. Let me know what else you want to see here\nand I'll do my best to do that for you in the days and weeks ahead. See you, guys!"
