    "transcript": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, AlthleanX.com. So, \nthe best part about today is that it s going to be   the last day that you ever say, I can t do any \npullups because if you follow what I show you   here today, I guarantee you re going to be able to \ndo at least three and most of you are going to be   able to do up to five in just 22 days from now. \nYou see, we re following in the footsteps of our   successful 22 Day Pullup Workout where lots of \npeople have been able to increase their pullup   count by one and a half to up to two times. \nNow, I get it, a lot of people commented there,   But Jeff two times zero is zero, even Jesse \nknow that math. But I can fix that for you   here because, like we said, we re going to \nget a progression from where you are now to   where you re going to be and we re going \nto include some all-important accessory   work that s going to be the key to help you to \nfinally start repping out those pullups. \n  So now mentioned some accessory work. Look, \nI get that you can t do a pullup right now,   so I can t just throw you to the wolves and have \nyou do a bunch of pullups. But what we re going   to do is some modifications of them and we re \nalso going to focus on two areas that a lot of   people tend to forget to do when they re trying \nto increase their pullups. And that is your grip   and of course your ab strength. Look, one of \nthe hardest things to do is just simply hang   on a bar. And even if you can do that, is to \nbe able to hang on a bar with stability without   rocking. The more of that rocking you do, the less \nstability you have, the more difficult pullups   become. But if we can get those things down, we \nre going to make these things a lot easier. \n  Now, the way these 22 days are going to be \nbroken down is into blocks. Each block consists   of a starting testing day, following by three \nconsecutive non-testing days. And from there   we re going to group them and perform five total \nblocks, which leaves two days at the end, day 21   and day 22, that s where we test. And of course, \nwe re going to retest what we tested on day one,   on day 21 and we re going to retest what we also \ntested on day 1 on day 22. Different aspects. \n  So, it starts with day one, our testing day. And \non testing day we have two exercises to do. The   first is an Inverted Row. Again, we re not able \nto do pullups right now, but we can do something   similar. We can still pull our own body weight, \nalbeit in a different plane, horizontal rather   than vertical, and we also have the additional \nbenefit of using our feet to self-spot to allow   us to build our strength in this exercise. But \nyour goal here is to perform as many as you can   to failure, trying to pull your chest as high up \nto that bar as you possibly can. Note what that   number is because it s going to come in handy on \nyour non-testing days. You then take a two-minute   rest and proceed to the second exercise on testing \nday and that is simply a dead arm hang. \n  Remember how important I said it was \nto be able to hang from a bar? Well,   we re going to do just exactly that, we re going \nto hang for time. And we re going to retest this   throughout the entire 22 days. The key here is to \nactually position yourself the right way, however.   And that is by getting your knees straight and \nour legs and feet out in front of your body.   Because you ll see there that this will actually \nengage your core much better than simply hanging   from a bar with your knees crossed and your \nfeet lazily hanging underneath. The stability   provided by your abs is going to make your \nbody move through space a lot more efficiently,   which at the end is going to make your ability \nto perform pullups that much less difficult. So,   testing days are just those two exercises, the \nmax number of Inverted Rows with a two-minute   rest and how long you can hang from that bar. \nSo, from there we then now proceed to the first   of our three consecutive non-testing days. And \nhere we have two things to do as well. The first   is one of our assistance motions that s going to \nallow us to start building that strength to do the   pullups. On day two, our first non-testing day, we \nre actually going to do a chair assisted pullup.   And the goal here is to place a chair in front of \nyou, ideally if you re doing this in a doorway,   we can just put it right out in front of the \ndoor. And we re going to position our feet on   top of the chair like this. They are not there \nto turn this into a squat, why they re there is   to actually just be there for a spot for you. And \nas you pullup the majority of the work should be   done by pulling down through your hands into that \nbar to lift your body using your own strength. \n  Again, as a spot only. And the goal is to \nachieve one half as many of your max rep   total from day one of your Inverted Rows. So, \nthat means, let s say you did 10 Inverted Rows,   here we re only looking to get these five chair \nassisted pullups. But we don t have to do them   unbroken. You likely don t have the strength at \nthe moment to do these unbroken. So, it s totally   fine if you could do a couple and then you rest \nand you go back and do a couple more, then you   rest and you go back and you do your final one. \nYou do these in rest pause fashion always making   sure to stop before reaching failure. \nThe second part of your non-testing day   is always now going to revolve around \nthe Inverted Row again. But this time   we re going to do more of them. So, your \nInverted Row total from your first test day   of 10 is now going to be done for 40% more than \nthat, so that means an additional four reps. So,   now I have to do 14 Inverted Rows, but as I \nsaid, you don t have to do them consecutively,   you can do those in your rest pause fashion \nuntil you accumulate your entire total of 14. \n  So, now on our second non-testing day we re \ngoing to just change that first exercise out.   Instead of doing the chair-assisted pullup, \nnow we have to work on our eccentric strength,   so we have the Eccentric Pullup. The idea here \nis that we know that we re stronger eccentrically   then we are concentrically. We can always lower \nourselves down with more control and strength   than we can to lift ourselves up. But by proving \nour eccentric strength we re going to actually   improve our ability to pull ourselves up. \nSo, we position the chair now behind us and all   we re going to do here is just step up, get our \nchin up over the bar, get those legs out in front   of us, knees straight, lock them out using that \ncore for stability and we re just going to lower   ourselves down as slowly as we can. Step yourself \nback up again here and repeat until you ve   completed half as many reps as you did of your max \nInverted Rows on that first testing day. Remember,   again, you still have the luxury of being \nable to do this in a rest pause fashion,   you do not need to crank out all these reps \nin one go. You can take that little brief   rest until you ve accumulated it all. \nThe second half again, I mentioned is going   to go back to the Inverted Row. But \nthis time instead of doing 40% more,   we ve got to do 50% more from that first day \nof max. So, this time it s going to be five   additional on top of the 10 from test day. Again, \nin rest pause fashion and your work is done. \n  The third and final non-testing day in your \nblock is actually going to switch it up entirely.   Remember how important I said the core was. Well, \nwe re going to do a core exercise and we re going   to done that mimics the requirements of your body \nwhen you re up on that bar. And we do something   here called the Hollow Rock. And here we get \nour arms up overhead, we get those legs straight   out in front of our body, very much the same way \nthat we re advocating doing the pullup itself. \n  And all you have to do is continue to rock your \nbody here and prevent your legs from falling down   or touching the ground or from overextending \nyour back back to the ground. The idea is,   can you stay in this stable position for as long \nas possible. I want you to make sure you time how   long and you can be here because you re going \nto be retested on this multiple times through   each and every block. Ideally, the longer you can \ndo this for, the stronger your core is becoming,   the easier your pullups are going to become. \nFrom there, again, we wrap up with the Inverted   Row done one more time, this time adding \n60% to that total from your first test day,   this time 16 reps and you do them once \nagain in that rest pause fashion. \n  So now you continue to do this block \nafter block after block. But remember,   each new testing day gives you a new opportunity \nto establish new totals. If my max Inverted Row   total goes from 10 to 14, then of course on all \nmy non-testing days, the number of may accessory   reps I m performing is going to go up and also the \nnumber of my Inverted Rows, plus 40%, 50% and 60%   are all going to go up as well. Utilize that \nstrength increase to your advantage because as   you get stronger you can reset these totals and \nkeep pushing yourself further, I guarantee you   gains in your pullup rep count are going \nto be soaring through the roof as well.\n  So, the question might come up, Jeff, is \nthis actually designed to be done over the   course of 22 days or can I rest? It actually \nis designed to be done consecutively, however,   if you find that you re not recovering or that \nyour numbers are going backwards for some reason,   then I would advocate that you actually take an \nadditional rest day before your subsequent test   day. So, between blocks take one additional \nrest day, but don t do anymore than that.   It s designed to work the way it does because \nwe re increasing your frequency of this   exercise in this condensed period of time. \nWhich brings us to our two final test days,   days 21 and 22. As I said, we re going to \nrevisit what we did all the way back on day one,   our first test day. But we re going to start \nin reverse order. On day 21 all I want you to   focus on is your performance in that Dead Arm \nHang. And here I have some big expectations.   I m looking for a 20 second increase in your \nability to hand from that bar. We ve been doing   a lot of hanging along the way, we re doing some \nadditional core strengthening to make that easier   and now you re ready. For some reason, \nyou don t get the full 20 seconds,   don t be discouraged, I guarantee you re \ngoing to see an increase regardless. \n  And that brings us to day 22 our final day in \nthis progression. And the good news is we re not   testing max Inverted Rows anymore. You see, we \nre actually now testing pullups because you can   do them. So, I want you to jump up to that bar \nnow and test how many pullups can do you. You   started 22 days ago at zero. My expectations are \nthat a lot of you are going to hit at least three   and many of you are going to hit five. \nIt wasn t because you just unlocked some   secrete method or you learned some secret strength \ntechnique. It s because you did the right work,   you put in the effort, but you followed the \nright progression. You didn t just try to jump   up to this bar and monkey fuck until you look \nlike you were doing something like a pullup.   No, you had a plan and you followed it and \nyou executed it and now you re able to do   three, four or five. Congratulations. \nSo, there you have it guys, a plan to get   you from zero pullups to a hell of a lot \nmore right now just by following the right   progression. I listened to you, I want to make \nsure that everybody that watches my channel   has all the information they need to get \nthemselves to where they need to be.
