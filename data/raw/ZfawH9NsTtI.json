    "transcript": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. We \ncontinue our popular band exercise series here.   Today I'm going to show you how to build a bigger \nback with just bands. See, a lot of times people   think they're screwed when they're training \nat home and they don't have access to a gym.   But I'm telling you, if you have a couple of these \nhere, you're going to be able to train your back   well. And not just your back, but I mean \nyour whole back. See because there's a lot of   different areas of your back that are important \nto train. We want to hit the width of your back   with the lats. We want to hit the mid back \nthickness with the mid traps and Rhomboids,   the upper back thickness with the upper traps. Of \ncourse, we want to stabilize and support at all   by strengthening our lower back. Guys let's \nstart breaking them down area by area, exercise   by exercise to give you the best of the best. \nSo, let's start with the lats, because most people   focus on building bigger wider lats. Remember, \nwe could train them two ways, we could go up and   down or we could go horizontal pulling motions \nfront to back. Well, when we talk about up and   down the staple exercise is always going to be \nthe pull up. So, what we can do is we can either   make it easier or harder. If you want to make \nit easier you put the band around the bar, you   simply step into it like this and this is going to \nunweight a percentage of your bodyweight. However   much resistance the band provides will assist you \nwith that much and perform the exercise that much   easier. Or you could do this and simply weight up \na backpack or throw a bunch of heavy things into   a backpack and anchor the band to it and then \nstep into it and put the band around your neck.   Now you've got a resisted pull up. When it comes \nto building a bigger back, don't underestimate the   importance of overloading and bands can absolutely \nprovide overload if utilized the right way.\n  All right. So, sticking with the basics here, \nguys have got your vertical pulling down. What   about your horizontal pull? Well, if you want to \nsubstitute for the Barbell Row, you take the band.   But what most people do wrong is they either grab \njust one end of the band or they don't provide   enough resistance. And it's easy to do because \nall you have to do is place it under your feet   and take a nice wide stance. What that does is \nobviously it increases the tension of the band.   But here's the better part, don't just grab one \nband, reach down and grab both of them. You can   see what the anchor point dramatically shortened \nnow, the resistance of that band has increased   considerably. Is it a complete replacement \nfor Barbell Row? No. But when all you've   got is a band, it's an incredible way to create \noverload in that horizontal pulling direction.\n  So now, while a lot of us will stop right \nthere and focus solely on pulling up and   down vertically or front to back horizontally, \nthe real magic actually happens when you do   something in between--transverse plane pulling. \nAnd that's what this exercise does. This is the   high to low Kneeling Banded Row. What this \nprovides us with is an opportunity to take   that band way out in front of our body and then \npull it all the way back down and around the back.   One benefit we get here from bands is that we \ncan continue to pull even an extra inch, which   is going to provide an increase in resistance. The \nother reason why this works so well is because of   those fibers of the back. Realize they don't \njust run straight up and down or side to side,   they do run in this southwest to northeast \ndirection. That means if you follow the fibers,   like I always tell you to rotation is the key.\nSome people might have a hard time generating that   peak contraction as you drive your elbow back to \nthe spine unless they have something else going   on and that is the other arm back there waiting \nfor it. Because we can create a more intense back   contraction by doing so. So, I like this for \nthat purpose, it's called the Two for One Row.   You enter the band in a low position and grab \non with one arm, you row it back until it's an   isometric contraction. Hold it there the \nentire time. It's waiting for that other   arm to meet it. How do you do that? You grab the \ntop portion of the band and with that other arm,   you're going to simply drive that arm back \nagain, trying to meet those elbows in the   middle. This is a great variation for building \nup that mind muscle connection that oftentimes   is missing when it comes to back training. \nWe finish up the first zone here for the lats   with two exercises that will actually allow you \nto take maybe the biceps out of the movement,   because a lot of times people tend to dominate \nwith biceps and pulling exercises, not so good   when you're trying to build your back. So what we \nwant to do is straight arm exercises that focus   on the abduction function of the lats. This here \nis the most classic you can have, and it's called   the Straight Arm Push Down. With the band anchored \nup high in the arms held out straight, your only   goal is to drive those elbows down to your size as \ntight and as hard as you possibly can. Resist the   tendency to bend the elbows and turn this into \na Tricep Push Down. Keep the elbows locked out   and do all the driving through the lats.\nThe second way to accomplish a straight arm   functioning of the lats is with the classic \npullover exercise. You might be thinking,   didn't you include this already in the chest \nedition of the series, Jeff? I did but was   performed very differently. Because instead of \nhaving the elbows tight together, I want them   to be flared out. If they're flared out, you're \nmoving the focus towards the last as the main   driver of the movement. Now, it doesn't matter \nof the elbows get much further than, let's say,   eight or 10 inches from where they start, it's the \nact of moving them towards abduction, towards your   size that's going to light them up and help you \nto use this exercise to build bigger lats.\n  So, if limiting yourself to a single vertical and \nhorizontal exercise wasn't bad enough when you're   trying to build bigger lats, skipping zones all \ntogether is a really bad idea if you want to build   a bigger back, especially with bands. But that's \nwhere bands come in really, really effectively,   because I'm going to argue this exercise here \nthat targets the second zone is one of the most   effective you could possibly do, and it's really \nbest performed with bands. This is called the   Zeus Row and it hits that Zone 2 middle and lower \ntraps, unbelievably. If you try this, I guarantee   you're going to say this is the best part of \nthis entire video. What you do is you anchor   the band up high and you angle your body forward. \nAnd when performed like this with a narrow grip,   it tends to minimize the contribution of the \nlats with abduction and really, really lights   up those rhomboids and lower traps and mid traps \nunbelievably, like I said. You have to try this, I   promise you, you're going to love every minute of \nit. Or maybe hate it, but it's going to work. \n  So, can I show you something cool, guys, when \nit comes to bands? It's not just the type of   band you're using, but how you anchor the band \nthat matters. So, if you really want to hit the   mid back, realize that the closer our hands are to \neach other, the more we're actually going to limit   the ability to pre-stretch that area. Because \nif I wrap it around something narrow here, my   hands will start and finish in this position. But \nif I were to take it around something much wider   and take that left over right, right over left \nthe grip, which is going to protract the shoulder   blades, which gives you that good pre-stretch on \nthe mid traps and rhomboids. This exercise will   do just that, it's the Wraparound Row. You can see \nthat by widening my feet out, I create that wider   anchor point. And by doing so, I could take that \nright over left, left over right grip and apply   that same effectiveness to this exercise. It's \na great way to target an area, that once again,   doesn't get hit often enough and bands give \nyou a great opportunity to do it well. \n  Which brings us to our third zone, and we're \ngoing to slide up the traps a little bit now   to focus on those upper traps and that thickness \nin the upper back. And this here is just a classic   Banded Shrug. And once again, you can see that we \ncan shorten the distance between our hands and the   anchor point. And that's where the tension really, \nreally increases here. Guys, remember, no matter   what band you buy, there's going to be a variation \nin the amount of tension it could provide. It   might tell you from 60 to 120. When we're talking \nabout maxing out the tension of the band when   you perform it this way. And most importantly, \nmaxing out the tension for the purpose of helping   to actually grow those upper traps of yours \nwhere you don't have dumbbells or a barbell.\n  Now guys, I'd stand on my head if it meant \ngetting you to do Face Pulls, but thankfully,   I don't have to because that's a little dramatic \nand by now you should know you got into your   face pulls. But what you can do is lay on your \nback and do this and this is a Lying Face Pull.   And the Lying Face Pulls give you an opportunity \nto do the same thing, to build up those muscles   of the upper back and also the rotator cuff \nand scap area, but it gives you a good target.   A lot of times people will struggle with making \nsure they get their hands back far enough   and what you do here is you just simply drive them \ndown towards the floor as far as you possibly can.   It gives you that end point for making sure that \nyou've gotten that complete contraction of these   key muscles. Hold it for one or two seconds \nat the bottom of every rep and I promise you,   you're going to fall in love with this \nversion of the Face Pulls, just like I hope   you love every other version of the Face Pull.\nAnd finally, that brings us to that all important   but oftentimes neglected forth zone here and \nthat's the low back. And we know that this zone,   when not paid attention to can actually undermine \nthe effectiveness of the exercise in all the   other zones. So, we want to do this and do this \nwell. And one of my favorite ways to do this is   with a band actually and it's the Good Morning, \nbecause a lot of times people just simply screw   this exercise up, particularly those people that \ndon't even understand how to perform in the first   place. What you want to do is you want to actually \nhinge at the hips and not turn this into a simply   a bending over to touch your toes type movement. \nIf you do this right with the band anchored across   the back of your neck, you actually get great \nengagement of both the glutes and the low back,   working in concert together to fortify it and \nhelp you to stay injury free for the long term.\n  And that brings us to one of my favorite ways to \ntrain the low back, and that's actually more of a   multi-zone exercise. We call this one the Superman \nPress Out. What this does is it actually engages   the entire posterior chain. You anchor the band \naround your feet and you simply crawl yourself   out into this position. Now, what we do is we \nlift our whole body up thighs off the ground,   just off the ground to activate the low back in \nthe glutes. But we travel all the way up that   posterior chain by engaging those lower traps, by \nreaching our arms up overhead at the same time.   This is going to be one of your favorite \nexercises to do if you never did it before.   As a matter of fact, it might actually trick \nyou into performing the low back exercise   because you have so much damn fun doing it.\nSo, they have it, guys no gains to be lost   because you're training with bands. If you want \nto continue to build your back up, you've got   the right exercises now to get the job done.
