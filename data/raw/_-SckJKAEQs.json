    "transcript": "JEFF: What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Wrapping up our series here on the big three. We’re going deadlift here. Another impressive lift for you. The deadlift. CASEY: It’s impressive. JEFF: It’s more impressive than mine. CASEY: Yeah. It’s impressive for having one leg, I guess. JEFF: Not just that. The one-legged monster, here. Wounded in combat, again. I think the biggest thing that always motivates\nme about Casey is ‘no excuses’. No excuses. He was dealt a tough hand, but that’s what\nactually allowed you to get into this in the first place. CASEY: Absolutely. It’s kind of built me to be who I am today,\nand it’s transferred over from me really pushing myself to, now it’s pushing people. Giving the whole ‘no excuses’ mentality. For me, with all the damage that I took from\nan IED blast in Afghanistan, doing these workouts, and doing this stuff; it’s truly painful\nfor me. But when I’m done and I’m walking out\nof here I feel like I’ve covered so much ground with myself and with people. JEFF: Yeah. CASEY: There is no excuse for why you can’t\nget to the gym, put in that dedication, put in that work, and live a better life. JEFF: I mean, again, you inspire me. It’s why you’re here in this gym, and\nnow we’re going to inspire some other people, too. So, the key thing is this: on the deadlift\nthere are some key moves I think would allow people to increase their deadlift. The deadlift is one of those moves, I believe,\nthat people have a high capacity to lift more of. CASEY: Absolutely. JEFF: And I don’t care what your bodyweight\nis. I think people can lift a lot more than they\ndo, but they really have to get some of those key things down. For you, the very first key accessory lift\nthat you like is the Pendlay Row. CASEY: Yeah, I like the Pendlay row. With the Pendlay row – you’ll be able\nto see here in a minute when I demonstrate – the key for me is I’m trying to do explosion. With the deadlift you’ve got to have a lot\nof explosion. So, with the Pendlay row, it allows you to\ndo that. Bent over, bar is at a dead stop, and I’m\nable to pull the weight up to my chest area. And, like I said, it builds a lot of strength\nand force out of the hole when you get ready to pull. So basically, when you do the Pendlay row,\nyou setup just like you were going to do a deadlift. Obviously, if you’re a sumo deadlifter you\nwould not setup in a sumo position because it would not make sense. So, the same thing. If you are a reverse grip deadlifter you won’t\nbe able to d that here either. Go ahead and do a double over grip. From a dead stop here, I always have a slight\nbend in my knees, and then come to a complete stop. JEFF: Again, not ever going down, bending\nthe elbows, lined up, getting stiff, lock them out and pull from there. CASEY: Yeah, absolutely. Guys, this is something that’s key. It’s one of those workouts where it’s\nkind of strenuous. Don’t get lazy with it. A lot of people, you’re going to get- JEFF: It’s taxing. CASEY: It is taxing, but it has a big benefit\nfor your deadlift. So, make sure you’re adding these in. with all the big lifts we’ve been talking\nabout, the number one thing is your back. You use your back in all three lifts. So, with the Pendlay row, we’re doing the\nrow. So, we’re working on the explosive muscles\nand we’re getting our workout in on our back as well. JEFF: And a key component of what you did\nthere, too. When you’re going for power, guys will sometimes\nsay “Oh, I’m training for power.” 10, 12, 15 reps. That’s not power. CASEY: Right. JEFF: Power is going to be, as you said, high\nquality. Quality trumps everything when it comes to\npower because if you start to lose your velocity, the power is gone. CASEY: Yes. JEFF: Power – velocity is, by definition,\npart of being more powerful. So, you have to be able to get good velocity\nand make sure every rep is quality. But when you load this thing, you could still\ntry to load it up as heavy as you can, as long as you’re not losing that. CASEY: Yeah, absolutely. You can. If you’re – I know guys that are 700lb,\n800lb deadlifters. They’re going to come load this bar with\nover 400lbs to do their lifts. That’s the thing with this. As it gets easier- JEFF: He’s talking about Jesse, by the way. CASEY: Yeah, Jesse was in here deadlifting\nover 800 the other day. Video coming soon. But continue to add weight. Yes, there can be times where, like I said,\n225 and as you see, that moves pretty well for me. I could have probably done 10, or 15 reps. That’s okay, too. Get a good pump. Get that form down. Get that velocity going. But don’t be afraid to add weight. But when you’re adding weight, don’t go\nto a point where the quality is gone. You need full extension, full to the chest,\nyou should be hitting the chest. If you’re doing little half-lifts, you’re\nnot getting the benefit out of it. So just remember, the ego thing. Would it look cool if you’re trying to do\n400lbs and 500lbs? It will look cool on the ground, but when\nyou go to pull it, and you don’t move very far, it’s not going to look cool. JEFF: It’s not going to look cool. CASEY: Yeah. JEFF: We talked about that. I’ve got more exercises that we use to focus\non the back. The second of which, is the straight-arm pushdown. CASEY: Yes. JEFF: Let’s go knock that out. So, the second lift here is the straight-arm\npushdown, like I said. I actually made videos on this in the past. It’s one of my favorite exercises in the\nentire gym that you could do because I don’t think it even has carryover to this lift,\nbut a lot of other lifts. It’s developing straight arm scapular strength. But as far as the deadlift itself, you like\nit, why? CASEY: I like it because we’re targeting\nthe lats. One of the things when people go, well, when\nyou go to setup for a deadlift, your lats need to be tight. Everything needs to be set, engaged, arms\nright outside the hips, and what will happen is, if your lats aren’t engaged – they’re\nnot tight – things are going to get loose. You’re going to end up bowing, caving, your\nbody is going to get loose, and when you go to pull your upper body is going to shake. You’re going to basically miss out on the\nlifts. This is just another technique that you can\nuse to strengthen the lats. And it’s good, to me, I feel like while\nI’m going this I’m squeezing, and it’s also teaching me mind-muscle connection on\nhow they’ll feel when they’re tightened. JEFF: And keeping the bar close. CASEY: And keeping the bar close. Exactly. Yeah, what Jeff is basically saying is, if\nyou’re here and your lats aren’t tight and you go to pull, the bar is going to swing. If I’m here, and I’m here, and I’m locked\nin, and I’m squeezing my lats the bar is going to stay right here. It’s going to stay right here, real tight,\nall the way through the actual deadlift. So, guys, on the deadlift, squeeze through\nthe lats. This accessory is going to help you guys do\nthat and it’s a really good tool to use for it. JEFF: So, knock one out. Knock a few out here. Get the whole stack here, as expected, but\nI’ll go up to a point here. Casey likes to use a bit of a wider grip here,\nor a wider bar. Not necessarily a wider grip because when\nhe does his deadlifts he’s really just outside hip width. But here, at least he can get it down and\nback. A lot of times guys will hit the thighs with\nthe bar right in front. This allows him to get it down, and through\na little bit, a little past the thighs. Just like that. CASEY: That’s basically where I – when\nI’m doing mine, I basically am here. So, I’m like “Okay, if this is how I’m\ndeadlifting, I’m right about here.” This is where I need to work at keeping everything\ntight right here. JEFF: Yep. And we know when guys go down to initiate\nthe pull from the floor, one of the worst things they could do is get some slack in\ntheir elbows and get loose. But let’s say you’re even doing it right. If you’re setup right, and as soon as you\ninitiate the deadlift your shoulders get pulled forward because you can’t pull that forward. CASEY: Yeah. JEFF: And immediately it tells me a weak back. CASEY: Weak back. JEFF: Right? So, when we get up here and use this exercise\nit allows us to keep that engagement, almost as if it – sometimes I’ve demonstrated\nbefore. I go down here and come up. I want ot feel that. So, I come down, here, literally come down\nso I can reinforce what that feels like. CASEY: That’s a technique I’ve never used,\nand I like that. Yeah. JEFF: Right, so just come down just to feel\nit, come straight up, and just so I feel like I’m keeping myself in, as opposed to letting\nit come out. Obviously, as I setup for more, and more weight\non the bar, it will want to pull me out. If you’re training yourself with these accessories\nthat shouldn’t happen. CASEY: Yeah, and like you said, when you go\nto deadlift, if you have a weak back or if you get any of that tendency to get too big,\nlike that; unfortunately, what’s going to happen is you’re going to tear a bicep. It’s going to be a long, painful recovery. So, this, right here, keeping it tight, keeping\nthe bar close, and just don’t roll your shoulders. This exercise is going to help you keep from\ndoing that. JEFF: So we talked about the lats. Sticking to the back, we’ve got one more\naccessory lift, but this time higher in the upper back, to the traps. CASEY: Yep. JEFF: All right, guys. So, wrapping up our accessory lifts here for\nthe deadlift, this is one that I do a ton, guys. You see me do this all the time. The dumbbell high pull. Casey loves this as well. There’s a reason for that. He does this one a bit differently, in terms\nof the weight that you use, and the volume you use on it, right? And the rep totals that you’re logging on\nhere. Why is it that you like this, when it comes\nto the deadlift? CASEY: This is really targeting the traps\nin the upper back. The traps are a huge stabilizer muscle in\nthe deadlift. With the deadlift, when you’re coming up\nto the top of the deadlift, the thing is to squeeze the back. If I’m doing this exercise, at the top,\nit’s a huge squeeze. Exactly where it is that I’m squeezing the\ndeadlift, at the top of my lockout. JEFF: Right. So, we were transitioning from all that lat\nengagement – lat involvement – and mainly, we were talking about from the bottom. Trying to stay tight through the middle portion\nof the lift. But then, as you get up, it really does shift\nup the back and starts involving more, and more of the upper back muscle here. CASEY: Most people will lose their deadlifts\ntoward the top. JEFF: Yeah. So, let me see you knock a few out. Guys, similar to what I preach here all the\ntime, Casey does the same thing. He leaves – he puts his thumbs up high. He’s basically putting – this is not an\nupright row. This is a high pull. He’s pulling with everything back here. Again, chest out, pulling high, really opening\nit up. CASEY: The thing with these – one thing\nI like with these is it’s not about going so heavy. It’s about getting that good trap engagement,\nthat good upper back engagement. And personally, these are one of my finishers\nfor my deadlift days. Something like this. Get a good blood flow in that upper back. Great pump and, like I said, it’s something\nthat’s key that a lot of people don’t think about doing. The thing that people say is “Why do you\nhave such big traps?” or “How did you get such big traps?” Here’s one of the exercises that will do\nthat. It’s a huge thing, at the top of your deadlift,\nto complete the actual movement. JEFF: And as far as your deadlift totals and\nstuff, obviously they’ve grown as you continue to develop your technique in the lift. But as far as this entire series that we’ve\ntalked about, these accessory lifts, on a scale of one to ten for you – I know we’ve\ntalked about how much time you devote to them and everything. But just in terms of the importance and direct\nimpact on your totals, and what you’ve been able to lift; how important is it? CASEY: It’s a 10. Without a doubt, we can’t say it enough. We really can’t. I can’t say it enough how important accessories\nhave been to make my lifts grow the way they have. JEFF: If you were to take your accessory lifts\nout of your training for the next six months- CASEY: My numbers would go down. 100%. They would go down. You’re not sitting there training the small\nmuscles to make the big muscles operate right. So, the lifts would go down. So, guys, the accessories are huge. You have to do these. You just do. Sometimes you are, like I said in the other\nvideo, you are burnt out sometimes when you’re done with the big movements. That’s okay. If you’re tired over there and you can’t\ndo these, what you’re tired from over there is not going to get any stronger. JEFF: Right. Exactly. So, guys, I hope you found this series helpful. Obviously, a lot of us care about the big\nlifts, right? CASEY: Absolutely. JEFF: They should be the foundation of all\nour training. We build off the big lifts. A lot of times I think, in a rush, we continue\nto add weight – we talk about this problem all the time – you start getting away from\nwhat your true strength is. And you start adding these compensations that\ncan ultimately break you down. You can’t allow that to happen. CASEY: You know, allow the accessories to\nbe the platform for your big lifts. These are what will generate the power at\nthe end of the day. The strength at the end of the day is these\nsmall movements that we’re doing. They’re such small movements sometimes. Something like this. This is a very small movement, but it has\nsuch a huge impact on your actual, big lift. So, make sure you guys are hitting these. If you guys are getting plateaued, you can’t\nfigure out why your deadlift won’t go up, your bench, your squat won’t go up; if you\ndo these and get religious with these, I promise you, those plateaus are going to go away real\nquick. JEFF: So, guys, again, I hope you’ve found\nthis helpful. If you want more o these, if you want us to\ncover more stuff here, we’ll be happy to do it here. Casey is always happy and willing to come\nhere and stop by the Xbox. We’re always happy to have him. Thank you for coming by. CASEY: Thanks, Jeff. JEFF: Awesome to have you, man.
