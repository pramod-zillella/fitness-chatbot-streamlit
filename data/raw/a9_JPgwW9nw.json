    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today we continue a popular series. The Best Dumbbell Exercises. This time, for the back. But instead of giving you a mind-numbingly\nboring, poorly copied video with exercise selections that are based on misinterpreted\nand misinformed EMG data, we're going to do what we always do on this channel and bring\nyou the unique training perspective of why we're selecting these exercises. Based on the goal that you're trying to achieve,\nas we've done this entire series. To do that, I'm going to select the best back\nexercises you can do with dumbbells for strength, power, hypertrophy – or eccentric overload\n– a metabolic effect, a total body exercise, a corrective exercise, and then our 'miscellaneous'\ncategory. With that being said, we've got a lot of ground\nto cover. Let's jump right into our first exercise selection\nfor strength. When it comes to strength, the goal is always\ngoing to be to progressively overload. To allow your body to adapt to get stronger\nto the movement that you're doing. While we have some rowing options we could\nincorporate with some dumbbells, I think the best way to load weight into your system as\na whole is to add some weight to one of the more difficult exercises, in general. That is the pullup. The pullup is one of the better back-building\nexercises you can do on its own. Add some additional weight here, as you see\nwith the dumbbell, and now we've really got something to work with. The fact is, we can add the dumbbell in a\nnumber of different ways. One, as I mentioned in the past, you can take\na leash and wrap it around the dumbbell you're using, just like this – I say 'a leash'\nbecause if you want to train at home there's no limitations here. If you're at a gym, whip out a dip belt if\nyou want. But wrap it around the dumbbell, hang it on\nyour hips, jump up on the bar, and go. Of course, if you want something more traditional\nhere, just place the dumbbell on the floor, step up onto it, reach down with your toes,\ngrab it in between your feet, and you're ready to go as well. As you can see, the back takes a tremendous\namount of load here. Again, the assisted weight is what's important\nhere. The additional dumbbell weight added to the\nweight of your own body creates a great opportunity for overload and progressive overload, simply\nby adding more weight to the dumbbell each time you do the exercise. Next we move onto the power selection. We know if we're going to train for power\nthere has to be some element of speed and explosivity to the exercise we're performing. For me, there's none better than this: the\ndumbbell dead row. The dead row is performed from the floor as\na great pulling exercise, just like the deadlift, but it stops at about the level of the knee,\nin terms of the hip contribution. From that point on, you want to drive the\ndumbbells up in a rowing motion, using your arms, and driving your elbows back behind\nyour body into extension to get those lats working. The element of explosivity comes from the\nfact that the ground-based force is generated through your feet, into the ground, and they're\ngoing to drive this movement to become as explosive as it is. You can load up the weight here as much as\nyou can handle, and this is a zero-momentum exercise that's going to require a lot of\ncoordinated explosiveness. Again, through your feet, up into your arms,\nand ultimately through the back, and the lats to help you develop some explosive power. Next up, we move onto hypertrophy. When we're trying to create muscle growth,\nwe look to do the opposite of what we're doing when we have a straight or power focus. Instead of trying to incorporate a lot of\nmuscles into the activity you're doing, you try to focus and isolate the work to the muscle\nyou're trying to create overload on, looking for inefficiency. Here, if we're trying to create more lat growth,\nwe need to make the lats do all the work. We can do that best with the classic dumbbell\npullover, as you see here. Now, a couple things about the setup. You want to position your body perpendicular\nto the bench instead of lying alongside it. Why? Because it allows us to manipulate our hips. You might be thinking \"Why is it important\nto manipulate your hips?\" Because we want to create more stretch. We want to give ourselves another opportunity\nfor eccentric overload and stretch on the muscle we're trying to develop. A known stimulus for muscle hypertrophy. We can do that by dropping the hips down. You see, I simply allowed them to drop, realizing\nthat the attachments of the lats are going to get further from each other when the hips\nget further apart than the arms. We can do that by simply letting the hips\ndrop. Now, as we drop the dumbbell back in position,\nyou should immediately feel a lot of tension places on the lats. You come up and complete this as you normally\nwould. Here's another tweak that I think is extremely\nbeneficial. You do some forced eccentrics. Some assisted eccentrics at the end. When you're done, just because you're concentrically\nfatigued, it doesn't mean you can't do some more eccentric work. We know that we're stronger there. And we can by simply cheating the motion back\nup to the start position. What I do is drag the dumbbell over one of\nmy shoulders, I extend it over my chest here, utilizing my triceps more than anything else,\nand then I go back into a nice, long-armed, eccentric pullover. I come back again, shorten the arms, take\naway all the concentric work – or as much as I can – I go back up in position again,\nand eccentrically lower. Do a few forced reps this way and I promise\nyou; you're going to get even more out of an already effective exercise for creating\nhypertrophy. Next up is our metabolic exercise. When we're training metabolically, looking\nfor that burn, we need to have an exercise that allows us to do it. But we don’t want to compromise the low\nback in the process because we know that any standing row variation, while being able to\nbe repped out through that burn, it's going to cause fatigue in the low back first. Which is going to compromise the safety of\nthe exercise. But we can do that if we put ourselves in\nthis position here. This is chest supported touch row. We have a couple things to discuss here. Number one: the position on the bench. The bench is going to protect that low back. It's going to allow us to fatigue the lats\nwithout having to worry about the fatigue of the low back posturally, that we would\nget in standing. Now, we talked about the touch row. We have these dumbbells placed out in front\nof us, and the ones we're holding are being targeted to touch those. Why? It gives us an additional stretch on the lats\nfor additional benefits as we go out with each repetition, out in front of the body. Again, realizing the anatomy of the lats is\ngoing to require the arm travel up and ahead of us to get more of a stretch. But additionally, those other dumbbells are\nliterally sitting out there waiting for you to keep that burn going. To metabolically increase the effectiveness\nof the exercise by simply drop-setting right down to them and doing another set as soon\nas you're done with the first set of dumbbells. This is where the metabolic effect comes in,\nguys. Remember, when you're trying to train metabolically,\nyou push to that level of burn, and then through it. For this exercise, because of that setup,\nwe protect the low back in the process and made it a much better selection. Next, we move onto the total body exercise\noption here. Obviously, to hit this criterion you've got\nto work your whole body. But we have to be able to hit the lats as\nwell. That's what this exercise does. This is the man-maker. With a single pair of dumbbells, we're going\nto be able to go from a pushup, into a renegade row on each side, jump right in, clean them\nup, stand and press, and come back down. If you look at the component motions here,\nwe're getting a push, into a pull, back into a total body push. So, I like the effectiveness of the exercise\nand the sequencing that it provides. But if you look at the exercise in a little\nmore detail, you'll see a couple of things. Number one: we're not compromising the back\nin the process of doing a total body exercise. Why? Because the weight is going to be determined\nby what you can renegade row. You don’t have to forcefully choose a very\nlight weight to be able to do the press. The standing clean and press is the most explosive\nportion of this. We're going to be able to use a pretty heavy\ndumbbell set to do that. So, really what's determining what dumbbells\nwe use is your ability to renegade row them. So, we're not having to compromise the effectiveness\nof the exercise in targeting and hitting the lats. A great exercise option. Again, if you put this into a circuit, you\nincorporate it into a total body program, it's going to fit in nicely, and it's going\nto hit your lats in the process. Moving on now, we hit our corrective exercise. You know how important the correctives are. They literally determine, I think, your longevity\nand how you stay injury free in your training. When you forget to do these, that's when injuries\ncrop up. In the particular case of the back, we want\nto try and work on incorporating the W-Raise. Where does it get its name from? It's the position of your arms in relation\nto your body. You're literally trying to form a \"W\". When you get into the position that I'm doing\nthis from, you'll see a couple of things happening. You're hitting a lot of back muscles, but\nmost importantly, you're hitting some of those back muscles that people don’t even regard\nas 'back muscles'. Namely, the rotator cuff. We know if we can get the muscles on the backside\nof the shoulder to externally rotate that shoulder, we're going to incorporate the rotator\ncuff into what we're doing. This is how the W-Raise will do that. We know, in order to get the hands into this\nposition, to create a \"W\", we need to get the hands back behind the elbow, into this\nposition here. That is going to demand external rotation\nof the shoulder. Different than if I just tried to get the\narms back behind the body this way into extension, which is going to mostly be driven by the\nrear delt. Not that there's anything wrong with that. The rear delt is a muscle in the back that's\ngoing to benefit from your trying to work it, but if we let the external rotation of\nthe shoulder drive it rather than the extension of the shoulder, we're going to get that activation\nof the rotator cuff that's being ignored otherwise. It's a really easy exercise to do, but as\nI've said, it's got a lot of bang for its buck. You're hitting, not just that rotator cuff,\nbut the mid-scapular muscles, the low back to stay in that position. The fact is, this all-in-one exercise is going\nto give you a lot of corrective benefits that are going to last long after this set ends. Last, but not least, we have our miscellaneous\ncategory. The one that allow us to assign one exercise\nthat hasn't hit everything we want to hit with these exercise selections. This one gives us the opportunity to go a\nlittle bit lower. I've mentioned it many times already, how\nimportant it is. That is the low back. For me, I want to do the bench reverse hyper. This can be a weighted exercise. For some, you may not even be able to tolerate\nany weight. But if you choose a light dumbbell here, it's\ngoing to apply a little additional overload that's going to make this exercise even more\neffective and beneficial for you. We know that the glutes and low back – which\nneed to work together – are not only chronically undertrained, but they're also chronically\nundertrained with weight. This is giving us a chance to do that. What you want to do is lie face down on the\nbench, as I'm doing here. Right about hip height, cutting off at the\nend of the bench. Now, you reach down with your feet, as I'm\ndoing here, to grasp the dumbbell between them. At this point, all you're looking to do is\ninitiate with a glute squeeze. Try to squeeze your butt as tight as you can\nand bring the legs back out behind you and keep them straight. It's going to start as a glute exercise, but\nwhat it's going to do is transmit that force upward, into the low back. Again, demanding that the low back coordinate\nits efforts with the glutes. A very overloaded, undertrained aspect of\nall people's training is going to get hit really well here. Do these for about 10 to 15 quality repetitions,\nmaking sure you're initiating this contraction, and maintaining the contraction with those\ntwo areas. Don’t look for substitution. Don’t try to swing the weight up as hard\nas you can. The fact is, quality contractions rule the\nday when it comes to, not just the corrective we just covered, but this specialization exercise\nas well. So, there you have it, guys. Hopefully you found these exercises helpful\nto you, depending upon what you're training for. Remember, no matter what it is you're trying\nto accomplish there should be a prescriptive exercise selection based around that. I've given you a lot of options here, depending\nupon what it is your focus is at the moment, and your training.
