    "transcript": "have all those sets a close grip bench press dips and even tricep push Downs not really cut it in terms of getting your arms to fill your shirt sleeves well instead of wearing one size too small let's actually do it the right way and start filling them up and while there's nothing wrong with any of the exercises I just talked about it might not be right for you so today I'm going to show you five tricep exercises that you should start doing that not many people are doing and it doesn't matter whether they're popular or they're not I made a whole video of the most popular tricep exercises I'm talking about the ones that might hold the secret for you that you're going to connect with and feel better and ultimately lead to more size and the first one is what we call the pjr pullover I mentioned the close grip bench press and people typically use that as a sort of heavy overloaded high tension based tricep exercise but this gives you another option so what I do is I get into his position here with a dumbbell and the key is to pick a dumbbell that's heavier than what you would normally be using for a regular tricep extension because I'm going to have the assistance of the lats so as I drop the arms back down I get a stretch yes on the left but also on that long have the triceps and when I get out of the bottom here instead of driving with the elbows and driving with the lats I want to go and drive up through extension of the elbows to the top and then let the lats assist so again a high tension heavy tricep alternative that might just hold the Gaze to the size you're seeking [Music] but we know that heavy weights aren't the only requirement to drive new triceps growth if you want a body weight option that doesn't require another push-up variation I'm going to show you something but to do that we got to break out tricep Cam and to do it we use something called the tricep trunk lift and obviously I'm down here on the ground what you do is you make two fish with your hands you put your elbows down on the ground and tight to your side and you're going to extend your elbows down and your hands into the floor and then lift yourself up off the ground okay knees are bent to help support lower yourself down slowly lift and press and what this does is it activates heavily that long head of the triceps because you're getting not only extension of the elbow but also extension of the arm back behind your body so extension at the shoulder which is a key driver of that tension in the triceps and again no equipment required at all just the floor foreign building up your triceps it's likely because you aren't paying enough attention to that long head because it's the only one that does something different we know that all three heads will extend the elbow but the one that brings the arm back behind the body into extension is going to be that big thick midi long head so we need exercises that do that he didn't just say that did he of course I did like the lateral medial head this one's long big thick maybe long head and the way we can do that is with the tricep push down but with variation you see because the rotational push down will help you to better Target that long head so what I'm asking you to do is not just bring the bar straight down in front of you which again is going to limit most of the work to the medial lateral head but if I can get that arm tight to the body and most importantly behind me well then I can start doing some things so what I do is as I'm coming down I twist the bar with me and turn it so I can get that arm back behind my body into extension of course I work the other side too by alternating again keeping the mechanics the same so don't be afraid to twist this bar as it comes down to assist that arm and getting back into extension and letting up that long head foreign so I know I said five exercises but let's just consider this one a bonus because this is actually three exercises in one but it doesn't diminish the effect of growing bigger triceps and this is going to take advantage of something we call a mechanical drop set if you're not doing enough of this it's probably the reason why you can't really fill those sleeves so what you do is you take your dumbbells and you perform the lion tries of extension to Star which we know is a great tricep exercise one that actually landed in the top spot and my tricep range exercise series but when we're done with this and we can't do another rep then we bring the dumbbells up and we perform a JM press where we drop them down to our shoulders and then straight up so it's like a modified skull crusher but without having to get as much of that tension in that overhead position that starts to cause more fatigue but we're not done quite yet because we know we still have some strength left if we get that assistance from the chest and the shoulders so we can turn this into a close grip elbows touch bench press so now when I've got just a little bit left in me I can still crank out a few more reps taking that to and through failure and through failure one more time to really light those suckers up [Music] what if I just hit a sore note with you and I said the lion tricep extension was the best exercise you could do for your triceps but what if when you do it it hurts your shoulders it just doesn't feel so good what would you do then well that's where you could do a variation on that jam press I just mentioned that still allows you to heavily load the triceps but avoid maybe that provocative position so you grab your dumbbells and you lay back down on that bench and with the target point being the shoulders here on the JM press and then pressing back up what you want to realize is that I can apply more attention to the triceps in this position than I can in this one due to that diamond force of gravity not being perpendicular to the forearm as much in this position it's pretty much parallel so I can take this and turn into a JM extension so I use a heavier weight and then press up and back that way down to the shoulders press up and back that way avoiding any type of excessive range of motion over my head that you might find uncomfortable so still giving you some of that benefit without any of the discomfort that would limit you from tricep science [Music] well while we're talking about that lighting extension can we least address some of those diminishing returns that we get at the end of the exercise you know in that end position because we could actually make that a hell of a lot better if we're willing to dump the dumbbells or maybe easy curl bar that we're using to perform the exercise and for me you want to break out a cable so what happens when we take the cable is we put it in a low stretch position like this and we come down into the same position on the bench now at the bottom we're going to get that nice stretch applied to the triceps that we're looking for but at the top the Difference Maker here is the application of force I still have a high degree attention because unlike the dumbbells that are just being held here in this parallel to gravity downward Force position I have that line of force from the cable being almost perpendicular to my forearms so you're even holding this position even though my arms are vertical it's still going to apply immense amount of force and tension on the triceps making this the same movement but a much more effective one by simply changing the way we do it foreign [Music] get the picture so remember guys if tricep sizes what you're after maybe the classic exercises just aren't working for you and that's okay it's just time to switch it up and give one of these a try if you're looking for a
