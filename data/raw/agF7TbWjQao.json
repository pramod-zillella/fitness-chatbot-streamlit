    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today I'm going to cover an exercise that\nI've been asked about for a long period of time. That is the rack pull. I'm going to hold off on defining where you're\npulling from because I do think it makes a big difference. We talk about the risk and reward of an exercise. At least, I do. I believe I bring a unique perspective to\nany exercise when I look at it. That's because I have both the strength coach\nbackground and physical therapy and I have to wear both hats. It's impossible for me to separate the two\nto evaluate the value of an exercise. When it comes to the rack pull, it's a controversial\nexercise. Some people don’t think it has any merit\nand some people think it's a great exercise. They will argue both ways. I think if we look at it from a different\nperspective it might open up your mind and change the way you're viewing it. So, when I talked about the risk and reward,\nI think you have to define what it is we're talking about. Are we talking about the exercise that's done\nabove the level of the knee here by a few inches, or I've even seen it done mid-thigh,\nwhere we're loading up hundreds and hundreds of pounds on this exercise and really trying\nto pull as much as possible? Either with the idea of building strength\nor using it for hypertrophy. Particularly of the traps. Is that the goal? Or is it down alternatively with a lot less\nweight, much lower? Either at the knee or slightly below the knee\nwith the purpose of it being an accessory movement to a much bigger, notable lift. Like the deadlift. If it's the latter, I'm all on board here\nbecause I've programmed the exercise as an accessory movement for the deadlift. What it does is allows us to work on an area\nI believe people don't finish a lot of times. They don’t finish the exercise. They don’t do the terminal range of motion\nthrough extension and that's a big miss if you don’t do that. More notably, it's a hip hinge exercise. It gives us a chance to work a hip hinge. Particularly if someone has a difficulty pulling\nfrom the floor. Maybe they have some biomechanical deficits\nthat don’t allow them to pull from the floor just yet. It doesn't mean you wouldn't want to train\nthem on a hinge. This is a way we could do that. But a lot of times we're not doing the exercise\nthat way. We're doing it to load up the exercise, and\nthat's where the risks come in. That's what I want to show you guys that I\nbelieve is a bit of a problem with the exercise. Because we know that the easiest part of the\nlift is the end of the lift – once we get past pulling from the floor, the amount of\nweight that somebody can handle on this exercise is enormous. That's why you see people load up tremendous\namounts of weight there. But that's also a problem because you're handling\nweight you likely couldn't have gotten in that position any other way. If you didn't have the rack here to set the\nweight up at that height and be able to pull your 2\" to 3\" range of motion, you probably\nwouldn't have been able to pull it in the first place. You certainly wouldn't have been able to pull\nit from the floor. So, what happens there is, you're subjecting\nyour body to forces that they're probably not equipped to handle. Therefore, it's taken the brunt of it in a\nway that you're probably not even aware that it's happening. That's right here. Again, I bring the physical therapist side\nto it because I have to. I've actually seen this happen to many people\nbefore. We're talking about this area right here. This is the thoracic outlet. This is an injury that's kind of on the rise\nof late. I don’t know if it's because there's more\nrecognition here, or if it's because more people are trying to do these things and attempt\nthese things with repercussions. The thoracic outlet is dealing with the nerves,\narteries, and veins that run from the neck down through your skeleton, out toward your\narm, and down your arm. Notably, when we talk about the nerves we're\ntalking about the brachial plexus, - this big, thick, yellow nerve bundle here – and\nits positioning in terms of how it runs through the muscles of the neck and most importantly,\nit runs down under the clavicle, under the pecs, and then out toward your arm. Then it runs all the way down your arm to\nfeed your arm and innervate your arm. What happens are a couple of things. Number one, we also have vessels here – the\nsubclavian artery and the subclavian vein that both run under here as well. They can also be equally impacted. So why is this a problem? Well, when you're handling weight that you\ncan't comfortably handle you get a lot of stress on the skeleton in both a distraction\ndownward on the arms, and also through this tilting upward and downward of the scapula. You have to understand that. The clavicle, which is the area that's really\ngoing to impact these nerves and vessels, is attached to the shoulder blade via its\nconnection at the AC joint. You can see that right here. So, if the shoulder blades are either really\nprotracting around the body here, or more importantly, up and down, up and down as they\nwould when you're handling a ton of weight that you really can't manage; then we have\na problem. What that's doing is causing, as you can see,\nthe clavicle to come up and down. When it comes down, you're getting more of\na pinch of the clavicle here like this, down on those three structures. You don’t want that. That's placing an enormous amount of stress\non the nerves that are going to give you some of these symptoms down in the arm, or some\nof the pain that you can feel here in the sternum, or some of that tingling sensation\nthat you can get down in the arm, or that numbness you can get down in the arm. Even through the pinky here. You have a problem with that. The next thing is the traction element as\nwell. If these nerves start up here and run all\nthe way down through the arm what would happen if I took this arm and brought it down even\nfurther in relation to the skeleton? From here, down. Down. We're taking these nerves and stretching them. All that traction, while it may be the main\nbenefit of the exercise in terms of its trap development, it's causing that side effect\nor repercussion of excessive strain on those nerves heading down to your arm. The thing about thoracic outlet is that it\ndoesn't really happen like that. It happens over time. Repetition after repetition. When it does happen it's one of those things\nthat you don’t necessarily know how to identify because you feel it in a whole bunch of different\nareas. Sometimes just diffused shoulder pain. You think you did something to your shoulder\nwhen it has nothing to do with your shoulder. It's the related nerve pain that happens from\nthe compression that's happening here, underneath the clavicle. So, if you were to lessen the weight and handle\nsomething you normally could you've be able to keep your shoulder blades in a much better\nposition. You can see Jesse demonstrating both versions\nhere. With his shoulder blades held in a better\nposition here – retracted, as you would when you're doing the deadlift. Guys, if you're not staying tight on the deadlift,\nif you're letting your shoulders round, you're going to do the exercise poorly. You can get away with it on the rack pull\ndone above the knee. You can't get away with it on a deadlift. It's probably going to show itself up in other\nareas, too. Like the thoracic spine and down the lower\nback. But you can't get away with that here. The thing is, if Jesse keeps himself back,\nwe're okay. But in order to keep himself back he's got\nto have to cut his ego down a bit and lower the weight. But if you're just going to stack up the weight,\nweight, weight and move in a couple of inches range of motion because you can handle that\nweight in that range of motion, what are those side effects? Look at the positioning of the scapula here. They're being protracted. They're being lifted and thrown forward. They're pretty much reenacting the job of\nwhat a tight pec minor would do, which we know is another cause of thoracic outlet. Guys, I think sometimes we have to look a\nlittle bit deeper. Again, you have to evaluate for yourself whether\nthere's a value for you in this exercise. If you don’t have to worry about anything\ndone overhead, if you don’t have to care about the function of your arm, or whether\nit's numb or not; you can probably go ahead and load up the weights and try to build your\ntraps that way. But I think there are other options for you\nto do that wouldn’t subject you to those things. As a matter of fact, maybe just working up\naggressively increasing your deadlift is the best way for you to get to the end point of\nwhat it is you're trying to do. You'll build your traps, you'll build your\noverall strength, you'll build more function, you'll be pulling from the ground, and it's\nan all-around better option. Guys, I hope you've found this video helpful. If you're looking for programs where we have\nto evaluate what we do – because it all matters. We look at both sides because it all matters. They're all over at ATHLEANX.com. We put the science back in strength. In the meantime, if you haven't already done\nso, please subscribe and turn on your notifications so you never miss a video when we put one\nout. All right, guys. See you soon."
