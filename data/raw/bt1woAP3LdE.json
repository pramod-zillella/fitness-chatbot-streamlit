    "transcript": "[Music] if we're playing I get the Packers I'm the Green Bay god doesn't matter I call dibs wherever stops very loose who is that you have no idea who that is yeah I mean it would be great if I did but but then I wouldn't throw to him not once really you should be me if you don't beat me that's embarrassing that's embarrassing if you don't win this oh [Applause] damn damn I opened my mouth way too early but game for you this is my life [Music] easy this is too easy this really hurts that I'm doing this because it's against the Packers you have force pressure what does that mean I don't know I think I got it on this one Oh Davante Adams he puts the team on his back I don't know only one that put the team on my back though you won't even say it right alright that's that's my bad on that one I apologize what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today special guest next to me gray Jennings NFL football player two-time Pro Bowler Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers that's right so today I wanted to talk about a lot of times people say hey Jeff show us what you do with your athletes can I see a workout that you might do with an athlete and we do a lot of different things that don't necessarily always make them their way onto YouTube but I thought today is a great opportunity and it's also going to underscore another point we're doing a dynamic lower body workout today meaning training for power training for explosiveness Greg retired from the NFL why is he still doing things to work on explosiveness speed power no we know why because I say all the time we want to look like an athlete you got to Train like an athlete guys there's no reason why even if you're not being paid to be a professional athlete you might be sitting there right now saying never been a pro athlete and I don't want to be one well it doesn't mean that you don't have to Train like one that you can't benefit from training like one and for Greg like doing this is certainly helping him to maintain a lot of the athleticism and strength and power he had built over his entire life building up to that point to be the best it was in the game so we're gonna do that today all right so we're gonna take you through guys a little bit he's just peek behind the scenes what we're doing here it starts with a warm up here nice and easy what I try to do I'm gonna kind of walk you through why I do what I do we're just gonna start with some leg swings alright we're gonna go across the body and you're gonna basically point your toe towards Jesse at that side and then kind of point toward the door on that side all right as you do it I'll kind of explain what you're looking for we obviously work both legs but we're dead rotation of the hip here that's up in the air right because he's pointing here so he's into a rotating his point here is externally rotating so we're not just getting AB and adduction we're getting the rotation too but look what's happening here at this hip this hip is also going through a lot of rotation right because as he opens up out there he gets external rotation as he comes across this body gets internal rotation here too and then each time just trying to like just let the leg swing you do it for about 30 seconds and then switch now you put the plant down on the other leg and you go across always easier on the second leg than it was on the first because you've actually gotten some of those benefits over there but just looking to sort of open up those hips kind of let the momentum take over and allow you to get into ranges that you didn't really have a minute ago now just go straight back forward and back now we're working more hamstrings and hip flexors so right in that sagittal plane here there you go and again just that the goal here is this to be free and loose if it was if we were doing something for the shoulder here we call in the pendulum exercises we're just trying to let the weight of our arm actually take us through here it's just letting the weight of your leg swing in good and then others time forward and back there you go really trying to loosen up the hip flexors try to minimize that try not to turn too much in this toy here you go so don't open up with the hip because if you do you'll get less hip flexor and you start to get kind of cheat it so you leave it there so you get the hip flexor being stretched out in the front next thing we do is we want to start we're gonna be squatting here box squatting so we want to do is this sort of open up the hips a little bit more as it would relate to a squat they're right about next to the band squat down open the hips up this way try to keep them open keep your head here slide under and then to the other side all right down step through and down here try to keep it open slide under and come through so now we're gonna work on a little bit the hip flexion with some depth so under there you go slide and come up good down open slide one of the things that kills me is how long people take Torm up like I think there's definitely an overdoing of warmups these days that's taking away from some of the benefits of the actual workout when that warm-up starts to become its own workout you got problems so now the first thing that we do is the Box squat and we're doing it again this is a dynamic effort day so what we're looking for is explosivity I'm not trying to max you out I'm not trying to wait you too heavily so that you can't get speed in your lift to me the most important thing is speed so you want to get underneath here come on you can work your way down I'll explain it we're going to get into this position where we set up a box that's low enough to allow you to get to parallel and break parallel the bands here are going to provide that additional resistance at the top so you come down to the box pause briefly and then explode up boom just like that we go for three high quality repetitions here down each one focused on speed just like that yeah nice nice to keep the head up both of em racket so the point here is that these bands as I mentioned are going to be providing resistance at most when they're most stretched which is at the top your strongest at the top of this movement so they're kind of working with the strength curve of the exercise your weakest at the bottom your strongest at the top these are gonna actually parallel that strength curve but more importantly they're they're kind of I like the fact that they give you this external feedback that you're trying to explode up against right you know that they're kind of loose down here you got to explode up against that resistance and you can feel it so this is that the weight that we choose here is basically about a combined weight of around 60 percent of your max so we're talking about let's say around a 300 pound squat 185 pounds would be about a hundred eighty pounds would be about what we want to be this is a 135 pounds here of weight with an extra resistance of about 50 pounds from the band's alright so we have this system weight here of about 180 but remember it's only that at the very top not the bottom if I wanted to go lighter weight with heavier bands you could you could you're gonna get a different feel because obviously at the bottom it's going to be lighter at the bottom again right because when once the bands get unstretched you're gonna be at your lowest point at the bottom so if you did that just realize that you're the total weight of the system's gonna be a lot less at the bottom and it is at the top this is about precision and execution so you're trying to get multiple efforts here like six to eight sets of these three repetitions always high-quality so that's our setup just as you normally would you can see the depth there is great explodes up boom reset and power up there you go good yeah yeah yeah we don't necessarily train with real speed if we're not intentionally seeking it out it's one of those things that I think our body tends to sort of coast and get through a movement unless it specifically knows what it is we're trying to accomplish here you know your goal is accelerate this thing as fast as possible that's going to help to recruit type 2 muscle fibers much more effectively than it would just at a normal pace squat so even that in and of itself is a unique training stimulus that you're not necessarily accustomed to now you you obviously are custom to this type of training being an NFL player but you know this speed and power is something that a lot of guys out there they overlook and it applies to everybody everybody can benefit from applying acceleration to their list load up nice it's perfect good stability at the top nice perfect so it's no surprise obviously with Greg like you know it's stability is one of his attributes like you have good balance good stability when you come through the top you're still stable a lot of times people come up and they'll be shaken because they they couldn't handle the acceleration of the rep all right so what you want to do is you want to make sure that when you're doing it's not just about the speed but that you're always controlling what you do as well the next part is unilateral I think is is critical to everybody I talk about it all the time the benefits of unilateral leg training and how they need to be worked into a complete lower body training program we people will oftentimes do a front foot elevated dumbbell Bulgarian split squat so we grab some dumbbells here and then they put their front foot up in this way here and then what they're saying is that oh I can get down deeper in this because I my knee is not hitting the floor here so I'm going deeper but the problem is in this particular setup where am I going from here if I go up and I stay over the front leg which is where you should stay to work this front leg look at how much range of motion I got like I'm stopping just a little bit above 90 degrees I'm down so I'm pretty deep but then I'm getting only here the other thing that people will do is they'll be here and then they'll make the cardinal sin of actually pushing backwards now I'm gonna have you try it there's nothing being done by my leg right here nothing I mean it can lift it up there's no work being done so when they do this and then they come back once I push back off of that front toe from here on out there's no work being done by that front knee at all so straight down you feel it much bigger stretch on that hip flexor but if you stayed over there that's all you got right you're done out of range of motion if you stay over this leg it's doing all the work but there's not a lot of range on that so now do what people do as they test which is that it's gone all right gone you can get the best of both worlds you don't have to compromise on one or the other and the way you do it is you just put the box out in front of you step up on here come back here now you obviously need good balance a lot of people when they just do this exercise at all they kind of wobble and Teeter a lot so they would kind of feel like they're losing their balance if that's who you are maybe don't put it up on a box and don't do this exercise yet because you don't have the balance and you have further the fall okay but if you have good balance there's no difference here this is like being on the floor right so what I do is I come straight down and now I get that extra benefit of having that knee be able to drop lower than the box which would simulate where they would have stopped at the floor so I have that extra range of motion and that accelerate up now I'm able to stay over this leg make this leg do the work and not have to compromise on that depth or not have to compromise on the range of motion like we were having to do before some down I get that stretch and then boom explode out of there down kind of load that stretch then explode out good straight down get that stretch you can see that knees lower than it would be come straight out now you feel you're over that leg was doing all the work yeah just like to ask perfect you feel stable here yeah more in that hypertrophy range not necessarily in the low two or three explosive reps but here we're looking to kind of get like in the 8 to 10 range we were talking about high school football before and how we were judged on what we were able to lift and where we were stood on the depth chart good nice whoo it's out you can put those right here so in that true like back back in the day you show up you know as a junior and if you increase your bench by 40 pounds and your squat by 40 or 60 pounds like the coaches oh he's been working hard you kind of work your way around the depth chart you know so at the NFL level that doesn't really apply so much how you perform on the field is really what matters the most how you position your body in space is going to have a distinct determination on what muscles are working so the same movement pattern can be changed in a slight way to make a whole other set of muscles take over what we're doing so if we did that the way we're just doing it up right we're loading the quads primarily the front side anterior chain muscles if I got in this setting now away from the box and I get down here like this and instead of being nice and upright if all I did was just angle my body like that all right from here to here and we're not lifting with the low back this is not a low back strain I'm just in this position here now when I come down to the ground I'm right here basically like a sprinter getting ready to take off by being in this position like that I've now loaded my glutes I've shifted most of the load from the quads to the back sides of the glutes so I'm here now I just come straight up from there okay down up down up leave your arms here let them lead the way straight down liking it there you go feel how that lit that up now yes so if you're in you're like a sprinter getting ready to take off hold it there for a second on the bottom hold it right there hold it now explode so we just taken that load from the quads and put it around to the back side and that's what a lot of people don't have they don't have the glutes at attention wanted to contribute in that bottom position a lot of times it's the quads that want to kick in and do all the work the glutes are literally designed to helped you get out of the bottom of this position to get out of a bottle of a squat to perform from the bottom of your office of linemen or defensive linemen down from a stance to get out explosively use them train them see it is real it's real so the reason why that works the way it is like if I were just gonna just react to what I do to you all right if I were to push you that way all right and if I were to push you this way you know certain things happen like that at a moment's notice and what's happening is when I pushed you this way you kind of went like that and the reason why that's happening is you're falling backwards you're going in that direction your body knows it's got to try to do anything it can to almost grab your shirt and pull you this way and what it does is the toes came up because those anterior tips are trying to fire on this side of your body your quads tighten your abs tighten that's why you kind of fold it forward all the muscles here are trying to do this contract and pull you this way when I went this way and I pushed you you went up on your toes because your calves backside muscles here trying to contract your low back your arms kind of went back this direction your direction and try to get your back involved all those muscles are trying to do that sort of breaking effect a pulling you like this even your glutes can try if we know that's the case we can craft that into the exercises we do by changing your posture ahead of time getting you to lean for is gonna load those glutes the way that they do so that they know that like we know we can get them to fire no one thinks like that in their training well I guess why you do what you do I do think that I've said a lot of times like it's it people I will make you know be less of a be less of a PT and more of a strength coach or more of a strength coach Alysha the PT whatever it is like that's not really I think the way your brain should think I think you should if you're bold you should think both ways and I think when you can think both ways that's when you get the best of both worlds you can blend them together and I think that's where the best results lie anyway you know instead of being so dogmatic about one things we can jump straight up here we can jump horizontally for for distance with broad jumps or we can do what we say C OD sort of change the direction jumping which means I can actually jump and change direction at the same time obviously as an advanced athlete like I know you can handle the co D stuff sometimes people could just do straight up and down or even some of the distance stuff so for this what I want you to do is I want you to start down here and basically work on that explosiveness or you're down up into that position here but you're still loaded and then from here I could just jump and turn that's the C OD work alright so a quick little hop from there to your feet there you go yep perfect and there's the in there's the twist so again this is about precision of effort so it's not about going till exhaustion and getting sloppy you regroup you're ready boom up twist nice you're just trying to extract high effort and high quality out of the work that you do it's not about going and breaking your balls so hard that you want to kind of when you leave the gym that feeling of like man I'm so done you know this shouldn't give you that feeling if you've done this right that's cool because a lot of times like naturally when you train you can't find it and what I mean by fine is you can't correlate that body part that you need to feel or fire mentally because you're so overworked with the weight right but with these weights I can find it a lot easier because the weight isn't the issue that's not my primary focus there's a place for just getting strong and being able to lift weight and move weight off of you as a matter of fact even at your position there was a benefit for you being able to get people off of you and create distance and separation at the right time but then there's a whole other side of it of being precise and controlled to be able to run a route to be able to catch a ball along the sidelines and be very precise and have confided control so it it's everybody again I say it's for you and I have you here demonstrating but it's literally for everybody everybody can benefit from strength and control and it's just really the holy grail of training good so what we do here is we would take it the same way we kind of treated our box squat you go higher on the sets six seven eight sets you're going lower on the repetitions here you just want to make sure that every single rep you do is quality and built for performance if face poles are my absolute must for any upper body work then a pull-through is sort of the equivalent for the lower body and the reason is wire because I don't think you could ever train your glutes enough the glutes are one of those muscles that get ignored or even when they get trained they get overshadowed because so many other muscles want to do the work for them a lot of times the hamstrings try to do the work of the glutes which leads to hamstring injuries so what we do is we we set up something here for the pull through and the pull through I have two ropes that I use here so now the problem with this is I recommend to roast your face pull so if someone at the gym is doing the same thing that you're doing here you got to be fighting for ropes cuz I don't know how many they have but you grab your two ropes here you step away all the way out here all right now this is obviously pulling my hands like if I were to let go here it's this gonna pull my hands all the way back through as far as they can go right so of course you don't want to be in this posture here you want to set up an athletic posture so you get your low back and less of a rounded position and you let your hands those sink back beneath you here head is up in this position it's really an athletic position here then all I do to bring my hands back I don't pull through all I do is I just squeeze right from the glutes like that and then when I go back I just let the rope take me back where it's going to go and what it does is it's naturally causing look at my hips a hip hinge right just natural hinge I'm not having to force that or work on that down and then up squeeze the angle of my body will actually stay the same I'm not doing this and then coming up and trying to thrust it forward I'm just coming from this angle that I established I'm coming straight up like that down straight up but all the work is done by the glutes and since you got stronger legs than me we're going heavy on that so grab those walk yourself out keep going there you go I put a heavy all right so now angle here this is tight just let yourself drop straight down you'll see the hands let him go back there you go now all you're gonna do is stay from here alright come straight up like that now let it just drop right from here okay and then drive through the glutes only there feel it all right so right there squeezing the glutes on perfect so you're not pulling with the arms that's not doing any of the work you're just pulling straight through the glutes and you can see each time kind of almost getting a little bit deeper that's perfect and the hinge this is what we're training the hinge so I think it's really important to train a hinge movement you know regardless of what it is in your lower body days especially on this kind of lower dynamic work for the purpose of getting an additional glute work it's great great and you don't feel any of these other muscles doing the work for you just kind of feel the glutes doing the work right one more yeah it's almost like similar to a kettlebell swing but it's more stress emphasis right right at the bottom of it yeah right right exactly yeah and so that I think is one of the benefits it's like it's not just getting you into the hinge but it kind of reinforces the hinge and it teaches you how to come out of the hinge only one way with your glutes doing the driving of the work now kettlebell swing is gonna do the same thing whether I bring it back and hike it back I'm still into a hinge here but when I get out of it you know a lot of people like to try to swing it up it's not it's really not a swing that the kettlebell should ride up on the hips it should come up on the hips I see people do kettlebell swings only out to here that's fine if that's all their arms are going there riding the wave of the glute activation they're not pulling it up like that and people that go all the way up to the top it's not that there's not a secondary benefit to that anything where you raise your arms up like this could work the lower traps as well which is good posture early for building some strength in your upper back but you have to understand that's the purpose that you're trying to do it for if you're just doing it because you're trying to cheat the swing then it's not necessarily helping you out so the good thing would be that a good transition from the pole through will be to actually work to a more explosive environment of that as you're as you're kind of power power movement for that exercise it's a place in everybody's training for this type of training I don't care if you're an athlete at the top level or if you're never played you know a sport your entire life there's benefits to it's more than just a slogan if you want to look like an athlete you got to Train like one in training explosively has its benefits even in terms of how your physique looks overall in the development of your physique because your training muscle fibers that may not be getting trained optimally the way you're training right now especially if you choose the same exercises all the time perform them in the same way and never really introduced new stresses to your body so hopefully you get an appreciation for that from this and you go try some of this stuff and as we saw it it definitely is real there's no doubt about it so you'll feel it but again this should feel kind of like a good thing it's like a recovery and the recovery day almost in between some of your heart or heavier sessions and there's a place for those as well so guys if you're looking for our complete programs where we put it all together step-by-step they're all over at athleanx.com if you haven't already done so make sure you click
