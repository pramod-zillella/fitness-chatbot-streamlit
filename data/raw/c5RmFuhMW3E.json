    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com so I'm gonna do something here for you today that we actually haven't done in a while I'm gonna give you a quick routine that you can do let's say a convincing routine to allow you to see that it doesn't have to take a long time for me to get a conditioning effect right to get a workout effect you can do this at home you don't need any equipment but what we're going to do is we're going to trade in some complexity for some simplicity but because when it comes to conditioning workouts consistency is the key just like it is with nutrition by the way if you want to be lean nutritional consistency in training consistency is gonna be critical for you to reach those goals from a training perspective though if what you're being asked to do is so complex they're gonna remember 20 movements and we're in a row you're not gonna do it you're gonna forget or you're gonna think to yourself I have to be able to dance the movements themselves we're gonna require that I move like Justin Timberlake to do this Justin Timberlake I am jealous of you I wish I could move like you I've always have wished I could move like you but I can't and it frustrates me but I can cover myself here in this workout because I'm gonna keep it simple for you guys and all we have to do is one thing we have to remember that at least we want to cover the three planes of motion right because we move in all three planes of motion it's not just sad Jule we move a lot in sagittal plane when we train with weights I want to be able to move our bodies and all three planes so we're going to cover the sagittal plane the frontal plane side to side and the transverse plane which a lot of us forget to do all in ten minutes the next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna vary the intensity because I know that not everybody starts at the same level but you need to be able to challenge yourself because the idea here is you know I could be doing this for an hour you're doing it for ten minutes but I want you to trade in that extra time for extra intensity give me the best that you have we start with the first the first one here is the sagittal plane this way in front of our body if we are just starting out even if this is super intense for you this is where you start you start by stepping through a mountain climber I step in I step in step in step in remember you're gonna have to do this for one minute straight okay all of these are done for one minute after you complete all three range planes of motion you get a 30 second rest right the next thing is we come tastes a little bit intermediates turn it more into a jog okay for one minute straight now simple not easy alright next one we go to the advanced level we got sprint this one out here sprit almost a hiney okay for one minute straight high intensity level next we step up we move now in the frontal plane side-to-side what we do here a skier move side to side but we start as always with a basic level we step it out step behind step it out and behind just like this step and behind guys some of the strongest guys cannot do this routine and then say it was easy I said it was simple and if you find that you're struggling with this it's because you are too one-dimensional in your training I don't care how strong you are you need to be able to translate that into something more athletic intermediate guys more of a hop okay cadence is still a little bit on the lower end what the hop is increasing the effort and then finally the advanced guys much more explosive hop hop hop hop crossover right side to side so I decided back and forth let your arms help to control your body in space that's two planes that would be the second minute the third minute we take now through a rotational plane transverse plane beginning this move here the key is it's called a step through you step through with your leg but you also rotate the hips that's key no matter what level you're doing here if you want to get the rotational benefits you rotate the hips rotate rotate step through hands stay down this way intermediate guys a little bit more speed and stay down advanced guys hand comes up and the speed comes up dramatically okay let's kick through so now I'm gonna take you through and show you how to do this minute by minute remember pick the level that challenges you the most but still allows you to do it after the first three minutes you get a 30 second rest repeated again 30 second arrests repeat it one more time there's your ten minutes let's watch it right now [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so there you have it guys a workout that you can do in just 10 minutes if you don't wind up like me at least a little bit out of breath so you haven't done it right guys because that is the deal we're making here training some of that length for intensity I promise you the results will be there for you it does not have to be complex it could be very very simple to do but it should still be hard and challenging there's a big difference if you're looking for workouts that make you work hard but they work really well in return head to athleanx.com right
