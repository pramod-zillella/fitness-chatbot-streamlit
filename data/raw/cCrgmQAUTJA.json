    "transcript": "[Music] hey Jessie Merry Christmas cloudy I've no exchanging gifts I wanted you to have yours first right exchanging gifts you are gonna love it's just like right up your I've thought long and hard about it four days to Disney World long spent Spade weight suite at the Four Seasons you're really sure you are worth it honestly yeah your gift is right here awesome markers these beautiful ones we were just using in a video yeah those are the exact one I know but it's the gift that you know you can use and that's the best gift right I will have another gift for you right here it is it's what games I'm giving you games you're going like this with your hands yes and I'm giving you games for storing punting games the gift that keeps on giving games I don't well it's like you always say it takes time to see games in the gym well it's gonna take time but games [Music] use muscle markers what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com so you want those arms to grow and you want it to happen fast like like that fast we're gonna work on that maybe not that fast but the thing is if you do the five things I show you here in this video by the way Jesse four seasons I get this you get you get the four seasons I get this I'm gonna show you five things that's going to help you to build arms much faster both your biceps and your triceps if you do exactly what I'm going to show you all right so we're gonna break it down one by one covering each of the five essentials then make sure that you see those gains a lot quicker alright so the first thing that you need to do is you need to kind of change up your mindset when it comes to training and like it or not you're gonna have to add in an arm day now I know you're thinking arm day is a thing of the past we don't do that anymore Jeff bro science says that that's something that we don't do matter of fact if you want to see gains fast and that's the key word to this video arm day better become part of your equation again let me break it down for you we know that total body training is one of the more popular ways to train these days and splitting your body up either as a total full-body workout done three times a week let's say Monday Wednesday and Friday or is even a push-pull legs or an upper and lower total body split there's a lot of ways we can do it as a matter of fact or unnoticed programs both monster and beast employ a total body training approach that being said you need to make sure that you're at least choosing some arms specific bicep and tricep specific exercises if you want to see the fastest gains possible it's imperative that you do because we oftentimes in our total body training will focus mostly on the compound lifts like a bench press like a row like a squat like an underhand row like a chin-up things that are actually going to of course help and assist the biceps to grow or assist the triceps to grow but not as direct arm exercises and for you to see the best arm games possible again the fastest you're going to want to make sure you're adding a few of these exercises to the end of those workouts but most effectively I think the best way to do this is just to add an arm day to the end of your training week if your training Monday Wednesday and Friday come back on Saturday or even Sunday if you need an extra day of recovery and train your arms directly now we're gonna get into the specifics of that day because it doesn't have to be that redundant or long or excessive if you choose the right exercises you're gonna be able to do it a lot quicker than you thought alright so now let's say you have that arm day in your training and you want to start mapping out what it's gonna look like what you're going to look for is the exercises that keep it simple but effective that allow you to just simply train harder on those exercises as opposed to trying to conserve enough energy to accommodate all the different selections you want to make like I want to do my preacher curls and my concentration curls and my standing dumbbell curls and my barbell curls and my cheek curls guys they're all curls if you look at the anatomy of the exercise when it comes to the arm portion of this you're talking about a hinge joint the elbow as a matter of fact it's the same anatomy we look at the other side it's the triceps they're controlling the action of the elbow itself they also have a secondary action at the shoulder flexion for the biceps an extension from the triceps but that will limit the exercise selection that you need to make gains from them as a matter of fact I talked about in previous videos that the majority of all of my gains as a younger kid when I started my arm training came from three movements this right here the lying tricep extension and on the biceps we had the barbell curl and the chin up or the weighted chin up that's it there hinge joint movements were controlling the elbow period we have the shoulder being influenced as well period that's it you don't have to accommodate all these exercises because when you do you start to make room for all that additional volume by cutting back the effort level to do this that's a mistake when you're looking for fast gains choose the exercises that are basic and push them hard and you'll see better gains from it so matter of fact if you wanted to get completely elaborate here's your upper limit choose an exercise when it comes to the biceps that places the most tension on the biceps in the stretched position like this the dumbbell incline curl choose an exercise that places most of the tension on the bicep in the peak contracted position like this a spider curl and then choose one basic compound lift like the barbell curl we talked about and for the triceps choose one exercise that again is the basic compound lift like the close grip bench press and then go for one that places the long head of the tricep in its most stretched position like this here and one that place is a long head of the tricep in that most contracted position with the arm behind the back like this here that's it that is your max upper limit work down from there but do me a favor start making smarter selections here consolidate that arm day and it'll become just a little bit of an extra add for you as opposed to having to become a whole entire workout plan in and of itself the third thing you have to make sure you do is never overlook the value of the east central component of the lifts that you're doing meaning you want to slow down the negative portion of the exercises you're doing no matter how limited the exercise selection you ultimately wind up choosing so let me give you an example here the barbell curl don't just simply drop the weight we talked about it all the time but when it comes to arm exercises you're being forgiving more here than any other lifts you could possibly do because when you look at the consequences of what's going to happen when you fail during an eccentric if you push it past concentric failure into eccentric failure the consequences aren't the bars can be dropping to the floor and if you're doing a tricep exercise the bargain probably dropping behind you but the idea is you're not getting pinned if you're doing a bench press you didn't have a spot you didn't have a rack to do it in if you went the east centric failure that bar is likely gonna wind up pinning you to the bench you're gonna have to do one of those maneuvers to get out from under that's not the consequence here a squat would have much more consequences to go to eccentric failure nothing I would recommend ever but to go to eccentric failure arm training is very forgiving that way take advantage of that don't overlook the eccentric it's one of the main ways to stimulate growth and especially if you want to see fast gains this is the way to do it now let's say that you have a lot of training experience under your belt and you feel like look Jeff I do want my arms to get fashion but I feel like I've tried everything then maybe here is we're introducing a new exercise or something you haven't done before it's going to provide that spark to help you get over the hump and if you're looking for one additional exercise or something new to try do this I showed this exercise in a video just recently actually Jesse incorporated just this exercise to his total body training and he got some pretty good results from it it's the waiters curl and the idea here is taking advantage of the fact that you want to try to take your forearms out of the mix when you're doing your bicep work because you don't want to start dominating the flexion component of the forearms to take over for the work that the bicep should be doing to flex the elbow and the waiters curl does that by actually keeping those wrists back in that position where they're not being influential here and they lift you're actually making the bicep do the majority of the work so try this if it's something that I haven't done before I guarantee maybe just like Jesse you'll see the benefit from it the next thing is you're looking for something new from the triceps I would still stick with the compound movement approach here but I would do a combination I would do this lying tricep extension into the JME press I lay down on my back I have the EZ curl bar I go back into a traditional overhead extension accentuating the stretch on the long head at the bottom I come up to the top and then I allow the hands to change the trajectories that are going back behind me they come straight back down towards my shoulders I'm allowing my forearms to fold back and I push out from there that's the jam press you're basically alternating between having a longer moment arm and a shorter moment arm and being able to prolong the set and get more out of your triceps in give in sequence if you haven't tried this before I promise you're gonna see some gains on the other end of it but the fact is guys if you're looking for something and feel desperate to change and add something just add one movement either one of these or both depending upon where your needs are and last but not least this is one that most people overlook when it comes to the arms and that is you gotta stretch them just like any other muscle guys these are muscles and you should stretch your arms out meaning stretch your biceps and stretch your triceps I've actually dedicated two complete videos to show you how to do this to your biceps and how to do this to your triceps the right way I'm going to link them both for you here at the end of the video but the idea is if you have tightness ha's in other muscles of your body what makes you think that you're not going to have tightness is here and when you do it's now we're going to alter the biomechanics of the joints that these muscles cross that's going to also be influential to some of the other areas of your training probably detrimental to the other areas of your training so stretch them out take those biceps and get them more range of motion so that when you go back to the exercises you perform you're going to get more from them you're going to do more work simply because you're covering more ground it's not always that we stop the curl here because we're trying to cheat the range of motion it could be that we're too damn tight and we never stretch our biceps out start doing it it is best done guys when you're done with your training most optimally at the end of the day that you actually train them so if you have an arm day you do the end of that day to re-establish the proper length of the muscle and then take that into the next training session with you guys I promise you this in the combination the other things I share with you are going to deliver every single time so there you go guys faster arm gains are on their way to you almost as if I went like that almost the fact is it's going to require some hard work but if you're willing to put it in this is going to work for you I promise these five changes are going to add up very quickly and very significantly if you're looking for programs where we add the science into the selections of the exercise we do but also how we do the things we do just like I played out here they're in all of our programs available over at athleanx.com in the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below to let me know what else you want me to cover and I'll do my best to do that for you and if you
