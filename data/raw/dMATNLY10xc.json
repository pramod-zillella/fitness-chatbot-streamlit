    "transcript": "you're in trouble i can't wait to get that hundred back what's up guys jeff cavaliere athletenext.com a little salty here jesse is it because you lost the last hang time challenge we had well i did want a hundred dollars and the giraffe no no you know you there's video footage jesse you stole the hundred dollars back from me and the giraffe okay on to the next point all right so i want to get my money back so we're gonna have another challenge okay i get to pick the challenge okay what is it uh pull-ups you gotta get to 50. no problem want to start right now i only have to do 40. wait so i do 50. yep and you gotta do 40. yeah it's a scalable challenge explain this to me okay if you can do 15 or more pull-ups in a set you've got to get to 50 reps total okay nine to 14 reps it's 40 reps like in your max set right yes okay 9 to 14 40 revs so that's why you're doing 40. exactly all right four to eight is 30 reps and if you do three pull-ups or less it's 15 reps all right now if people are struggling with pull-ups to do that many i definitely recommend you watch our pull-up tutorial on how to build up those pull-up numbers up to at least five yeah all right now how are we enforcing this you got to get your chin all the way up over the bar okay you got to come all the way down and then you got to pause for a second so we're going to count the ropes count the right by the bot in other words we vote we count out the rep at the bottom right all right cool so but it's not just reaching 50 reps right it's actually how many sets it takes you to get to 50 reps or for me 40 reps i got it so the challenge here is how many sets does it take you to hit that number that is the number and what i'll do is at the end of the video guys we'll put up the scale so you can see where you stand yeah all right and then there's no rest time in other words however long it takes me to go up there once i'm done you jump up you go and we keep going until we hit our number exactly i want 100 back let's go good luck you're up your challenge you go you got the honors so i'm going to keep track over here okay so we'll go what the set you do and then the total reps that you do in that set we'll keep a running total of the reps as you go down okay remember i'll count for you okay all right here we go one remember that pause two three four five we've shown off that new tattoo six seven eight nine 10. get that chin up 11. all right go 11. first set i go there's a strategy here too one one sorry two three four five six seven 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 10 15. i'll stop there i'll stop there all right mark it down set one seven ten so 17 to 11. but you got 40 i got 50. let's go all right well get up over that bar two three four five might want to play the strategy game here oh by the by their beard six so that's set two you got six you're in trouble oh i'm in big trouble i can't wait to get that hundred back one two three four five six seven oh my god i got hard quick eight 25. i'm halfway home oh this is supposed to be two oh yeah all right the smart game here now one so there's a strategy you may not want to take it all the way to failure because the quick turnaround here in between sets what was that three two three well that brings you 20. so you're halfway after three sets i'm halfway after two oh you think you're awesome my math tells me that i will get there quicker by doing it that way we'll see all right come on man one two three four they're gonna hold it there i'm gonna hold it there all right 29 i should've done one more all right 29 okay three sets one see a strategy i got you back up on the bar faster three again three you're making it harder on me because you're only going for a few seconds it's part of the strategy 23. yep oh my god this is this is rest time that's killing me five oh my god 15 left let's go you got 17 left one two all the way down we got one more others oh wow they pulled the fourth one out you try five you're done you're toast no no it's on the fifth set you have four 27. you got 13 left if i did two here that would keep us tied all right let's go don't rush me one two all right so i've got 11 left he's got 13. one all the way down two there's two six suck 29 29. this is not fun well obviously if you were doing this on your own and you were resting longer you'd probably have fewer sets but it's the quick turnaround time that we're going for the long rest you got here i was i was you know trying to draw this out all right one two all right i gotta finish this in two more sets one two stuck at the two seven 31. at that pace you got about eight more sets all right i got eight left right yep all right one two three four i think i'll leave it there i gotta get more my last four instead eight 46. trying to do math let's go good at it hold on down you know a few seconds like you did stall tactic i'm familiar with it gives you two hit a third oh i can't get three damn it so by my math that leaves you at 33 and eight sets if i get my four i'm done in eight sets that hunter's coming back here right in my pocket all right four one two three oh i'm over there four i'm over there how long is it gonna take you let's go don't keep them waiting too long let's go give me at least two more sets don't keep on waiting too long it's 34 35 maybe it's easier that way 30 35. let me give you a reprieve i'll jump up there for my one rep just in case there's any question about that that's fair is that one better that was way better okay even if that is my ninth set that's that's still beating you come on five more let's go one two come on that's 10. guys this is way harder than you think 37. you're gonna get three more three more you get listen they're pulling for you three in this one set you haven't been able to get three since set four oh man don't rub it in two two two two two two give me three one oh i can't even get two there wait set 11 38. you're just dragging out this video time that's what you're doing he's looking for the watch time watch time there's one one more one more oh get up there shake it out let's go 12 39 let's go one more baby one more and no momentum get up there pull it up there you go unlucky number 13 jesse that sucks unlucky number 13. all right so there you are guys a challenge as easy as it sounds just 50 pull-ups or 40 or 30 or 15. it's a lot harder to execute it especially if you're on those short rest times where this stacks up when you do the challenge remember do it at the level that you're at and however many sets it takes here's your scoring jesse while you're at it while you're a little bit of swell you might as well show off your new tattoo that's as big as the eagles ever gonna get i'm gonna tell you that guys remember push yourself on this it's actually pretty fun especially if you have somebody to do it with if you're looking for programs where we build challenges into everything we do to push you to the levels that
