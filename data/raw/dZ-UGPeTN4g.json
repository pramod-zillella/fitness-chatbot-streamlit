    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere\nathleanx.com if you've got rounded shoulders you're gonna want to watch\nthis video I'm gonna tell you this we know that it not only aesthetically\nlooks bad but it's also something that's going to set you up for a long term bad\nprognosis for you and your shoulder health you're going to likely wind up\nhurting yourself in the gym if you're walking around and/or training with\nForli rounded shoulders well who knew the biceps we're gonna be here to rescue\nyou I'm going to show you today how a single\ncurl done with a pair of dumbbells and a wall is going to help you to start\ngetting rid of those Forli rounded shoulders improve your posture and the\nsame time actually build some bigger biceps so what we're talking about is\nthis it's all founded on the fact that with our own anatomy here guys if you\nlook at the elbow when I hold my arm down at my side it doesn't just go\nstraight down my elbow actually goes down from here at the elbow joint and\nactually radiates or deviates out a little bit to this side out that way and\nthat's actually called the carrying angle of the elbow and the reason why we\ncall it carrying angle is because it assists us when we're trying to carry\nsomething at our sides instead of it being straight down on our sides wood\neverything we were carrying would rub up against our legs and interfere with our\nability to walk and carry at the same time but because it deviates a little\nbit that way we're able to carry something walk and not have it hit our\nlegs and impede our ability to move that's important because if you look at\nthat when I actually curl up where's the dumbbell go it actually goes up and then\nthat way a little bit more okay it falls out side of my shoulder okay what does\nthat do to the shoulder itself it's actually allowing us to get external\nrotation at the shoulder it's a component motion of being able to get an\nexternally rotated shoulder as opposed to an internally rotated shoulder which\nis exactly what we have too much of when we have forward rounded shoulders beyond\nthat if we actually contract the biceps fully we have supination and supination\nmeans we're going to turn the forearm up and then out which again feeds that even\nmore the supination allows us to get more of an externally rotated position\nhere in the shoulder if I were to take that one step further we know that the\nbiceps actually flex the shoulder forward\ngo that way so if I'm in that super name position elbow bent and my arm is up\nbeyond that point more I'm actually externally rotating even more so if we\nknow that the bicep in its actions feed external rotation as much as it does\nthen why are we not taking advantage of that when we do our bicep training\nbecause we know it's another weapon in our arsenal for getting better posture\nso what we do is we actually use these dumbbells and an exercise I've\nintroduced in the past called the no-money curl but I've now developed a\nnew wrinkle for it to make sure that you're all doing it right because the\nthing is this if you think you're doing it right you get it wrong you're not\nreally doing the benefit that you're that I'm proposing here that you can get\nso what you do is you back up into a wall okay it hold your elbows out to the\nside here like that alright now when you do the exercise and you curl up you're\ngonna curl and try to hit the wall with the back side of that dumbbell okay so\nyou're down here you're up and hit the back side of the wall what it looks like\nwhen you do it two times two arms at a time is this set here curl up and press\ndown up touch down up touch touch what you're doing there and no you're gonna\nhave to drop the weights a little bit from what you're used to is again I'm in\nhere and coming up and I'm externally rotating you can see I'm opening up the\nchest I'm opening up the shoulders externally rotating strengthening the\nrotator cuff at the same time that I'm doing all the motions of the biceps so\nI'm able to build bigger biceps too the fact is this guys if you understand how\nyour muscles prefer to work together you would have noticed this already you\nwould have realized that this is a great exercise to not just always banging away\nat regular curls or hammer curls or things that actually already internally\nrotate your arms this is one of those key opportunities to still train the\nmuscle you're trying to train but sneak in almost unnoticed\nthat extra work that helps to help balance out that posture get rid of all\nthis rounded shoulder craft and work towards getting long-term shoulder\nhealth at the same time because guys it doesn't matter how big you are if you\ncan't continue to Train it's not going to matter\nyou want to train hard but you want to train smart and athlean-x is all about\nthat regarding this rounded shoulders stuff guys I actually have another video\nwhere it addresses some of the tightness is that you develop from having rounded\nshoulders particularly in the pecs I'll link that in the description below this\nis what it looks like here but in the meantime if you're looking for a program\nthat lays it all out step-by-step puts the science back in strength guys\nbecause all this stuff doesn't matter our Anatomy is step in a certain way\nbecause it actually matters we work that into every program we have all over at\nathlean-x calm and found this video helpful leave your comments and thumbs\nup below let me know if what I'm going to cover I'll do my best to do that here\nfor you in the days and weeks ahead alright guys see you soon you"
