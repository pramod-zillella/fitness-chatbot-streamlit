    "transcript": "JEFF: What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Dude…you're making me uncomfortable. JESSE: Why? Oh, was it because of my exercises? Dude, my rotator cuff feels great. JEFF: Can you get behind the camera, please? JESSE: You sure? JEFF: I'm positive. JESSE: Okay. Okay. JEFF: Creep. I'm positive. All right, guys. Today, let's talk about what we're really\nhere to talk about. That is, the face pull. A lot of people don't do this exercise right. And some of you, I don’t blame because there\nare literally tutorial videos out there with millions of views that are not only showing\nyou an incorrect way to do the exercise, but it's the direct way to hurt yourself doing\nthe exercise. That's not what we want. So, I want to make sure you do this right. I know we've become a little synonymous with\nthis exercise, but for good reason. I'll wear that badge proudly because I believe\nthis is an incredibly important exercise. Not just to build the stability of your upper\nbody and torso for your bigger lifts, but more importantly, to your overall posture\nand health. So, we need to do it. What I'm going to do is cover a few different\nelements here. I want to talk about the equipment you use. The height you want to set it at. The grip that you're going to use – because\na lot of people screw that up. The stance you take when you do the exercise. The travel, and what the key points are when\nyou start to move the band. And then some alternatives. More importantly, when you program it, what\ntype of weight you're using, what type of reps, and then where you program it into your\noverall plan. So, we start here, first and foremost, with\nthe equipment. You might be training at home, or you might\nbe training at the gym. In the gym you'd have access to a cable, which\nI prefer, but I'll get to that in a second. If you're home, it doesn’t mean you can't\ndo it. It just means that you have to be alert of\nsomething or aware of something. That is, when you do it with a band the strength\ncurve on a band is different than when you're going to encounter on a cable here. As you stretch the band further and further\nout it gets more and more difficult. But the most difficult portion of this exercise\nis the end. So, if I were to start and try to do full\nrange of motion where my arms are out in front of me, getting some scapular protraction here,\nand then I come back into the face pull I hit a wall. I don’t have the strength because this band\ngot too hard, too quick. I'd either have to compromise and use a lighter\nband, or I'd have to stand closer here and start in the midrange of the exercise so I\ncan get in position at the end. It's something you have to be aware of if\nyou're going to train at home. Ideally, you would use a cable machine. But what would you attach here? You wouldn't want to attach a bar to this\nbecause you're going to limit the amount of rotation you can get, which is an all-important\ncomponent of this exercise through your shoulders. So, you'd use a rope. But the problem with one rope is that it's\noften times not long enough. As you'll see here, we're going to want to\nget our arms out wide. Not just here, but out wide so we can get\ninto external rotation. This is limited by the use of a single rope. You could either attach a sled rope like this\nto get more length, or what I like to do is take another rope from the gym, pull that\none down, attach a second rope, and now I've got the length I need to maintain that position\nhere. So that's what you want to make sure you can\ndo to get yourself in the right spot. The next thing would be, what is the height? Where do you want to set the height here? Again, you see some people taking this thing\nfrom a low position. The problem with low is that it's setting\nup the wrong mechanics of the exercise. You don’t pull from low to high. You saw Jesse doing this. We call it the 'upright pull'. It's horrible for your shoulders. You're basically performing an upright row\ninstead of a face pull. But what's more important is when you resist\nyourself from low to high, you're asking for an eccentric contraction of the rotator cuff,\nin the external rotators of the shoulder to counteract that because you're being pulled\ndown, and forward. This is the angle. Down and forward. You want to make sure you have yourself going\nfrom high to low because if I'm getting pulled in this direction, not only is my arm getting\npulled there, but my back gets pulled there, too. I lose my thoracic extension. What happens there is the amount I can externally\nrotate – and you can do this yourself, right now – if you round your thoracic spine and\ntry to externally rotate you only get a certain amount. If I were to stand up into full extension,\nnow I get an extra 20 degrees of external rotation. So, if we could fix that just by making this\nthing anchor high, that's what we would do. Now, by getting in this high anchor position\nwhen I pull back, I'm concentrically pulling back into external rotation. Strengthening those muscles there, the ones\nthat we're trying to work on the most, along with the rear delts, and of course, the mid\nscap, rhomboids, and traps. So, I'm in this position here. So, you want to pull from high to low. Next is the stance. How do you stand? People say, \"I'm never sure if I'm supposed\nto stand square, or if I'm supposed to stand like this, or if I'm supposed to put my leg\nup on something.\" No. You don’t want to do that. You want to stand square, if at all possible. It's more athletic. You get to a more athletic stance. You square up and you pull. What it does is regulates the amount of weight\nyou can use. So, I can't overload this to the point where\nit degrades the form on the exercise because if I try to go so heavy that I'm getting pulled\nforward I'm going too heavy. It's an easy sign for you to know that. But you want to be able to square up here\nand pull around that torso this way. If you have to. If it's not because you're using too heavy\nof a weight, but because you have bad balance; you can get into a staggered position here. But square up your hips, square up your shoulders,\nand pull that way throughout the exercise. Here's where it gets really important. It's the grip. What is the – how are you gripping this\nrope? All the time I see people – especially if\nyou're correctly putting it up high – they take an overhand grip, and overhand grip,\nand then they pull. What this is promoting is, again, internal\nrotation of the shoulder with elevation of your arms up overhead. You don’t want to be there. Especially if you do this as often as I'm\ngoing to recommend you do this. You're accumulating a lot of repetitions in\nan internally rotated shoulder position with elevation. Not a good idea. So instead, you grab it from underneath, and\nunderneath. You point your thumbs backward. Now when I grip it this way and I come back\nyou can see I'm getting external rotation of the shoulder at the top with elevation\nhere, as opposed to internal rotation. Which leads us right into the trough lift. What the exercise looks like when you start\nto perform it. There are two things you really want to focus\non here. The first thing is: where are you pulling\nto? What's the destination? This should be easy, but it gets screwed up\na whole hell of a lot. This is a face pull. So that means you're pulling to your face,\nright? Right around your nose. My big nose is a nice target for me. I can come right toward my nose and if I could,\nI'd pull it right in here. A face pull. It's not a clavicle pull, in here. You're not trying to pull down there. It's not a chest pull. It's not an overhead pull like that. It's a face pull. So, you want to make sure that's your destination. In terms of the main driver of this, this\nis what's key. What wins the race to the back position there? Your elbows or your hands? The answer is: your hands. This is where I think people get this wrong\nall the time. They let their elbows win. They do this. They do this. This is an elbow beating my hand. My hand is the length of my forearm away from\nmy elbow right now. That's not what I want. Once again, that's internal rotation with\nelevation. What I need to do is let my hands beat my\nelbows in a race to the back. I come in here, the hand beats the elbow. What that ensures is that I'm getting external\nrotation. What I'm really trying to do here is close\ndown the back here. Open the chest, close down the back. Squeeze those shoulder blades. Externally rotate. Get the rotator cuff involved. Let the traps pull and help. We want to make sure the real race is being\nwon by the rotator cuff in this exercise. Not by the rear delt in some sort of row. That's a different exercise. The benefit of this exercise is driven by\nthe rotator cuff. If you can't do that there are a couple of\nmodifications that will help you. The first one to reinforce that is to get\ndown on the ground. If I get down here and perform this, if I\nlead with the elbows my hands don’t come anywhere close to the ground. So, what I can do is come down here and make\nsure my hands, or at least the nubs of the rope, make contact with that ground, and my\nelbows are elevated here. I squeeze for a second or two, and I come\nback up. Down, and I hold and squeeze. Don’t let the hands drift. Keep them down in contact with the ground. It's not just a great way to feel this, it's\na great way to do the exercise. But another variation you can do as an alternative,\nto add more to this exercise than what I've shown you recently, is by adding a raise of\nthe arms at the top. So, I get back here, and then I raise the\narms up, and I come back down. What this is doing is adding the lower traps\nto the equation here. We're already hitting almost everything in\nour back. The lower traps are really important for creating\nstability of the scapula as we raise our arms up over our head. So, we don’t want to ignore that. If we can build that in with a simple raise\nof the arms at the end here, holding isometrically in that back position, why wouldn't we do\nit? It's a bit more complicated. It does require a little more strength, but\nit's one that you want to explore if you can. The last two things are about how you would\nprogram this from a weight perspective – as sets, that type of thing – and also how\nfrequently. Weights. I mentioned before, not so heavy that it's\npulling you forward, but not so light that the exercise becomes ridiculous. People will think this is a corrective exercise\nand they'll come in and get limp here. This is not helping. This is not helping. What you do is make sure you're using enough\nweight to create strength benefits. You're trying to strengthen weak muscles that\nare being compromised by over dominate, anterior chain muscles that have put you in this position. These need to get stronger. So, choose a weight that is a resistance that's\nchallenging for you. But most importantly, it's the set-rep structure. If you're going to do 10 to 12 reps of these,\nmake sure it's 12 sets of 1, or 10 sets of 1. That's the mentality. Every, single one of them has to be a good,\nsolid contraction here. Squeeze, hold, raise up if you're going to,\ncome down, and rest. Reset. Come back. High quality repetition. Come up, down, and through. That's the key to the effectiveness of the\nexercise. It's the quality. In terms of how frequently you want to do\nthis, you would work it in as I've said before in a video, every workout. At the end of every, single workout. I don’t care if you're working your legs,\nor you're working your back, or you're pull, or push, or whatever. You can benefit from a couple of sets of face\npulls here. You're not going to over train with these. It's just addressing a weakness, and the postural\neffects that this weakness has on you through a little more regular frequency. Guys, I hope you've found this video helpful. This tutorial is meant to be complete, so\nyou actually get this right. If you're going to be doing these as often\nas I recommend, if you place the important on this exercise that I recommend, I've got\nto make sure you get it right.
