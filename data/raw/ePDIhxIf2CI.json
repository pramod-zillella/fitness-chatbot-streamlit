    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. How many times have you seen this? No, not me holding a skeleton. Although, that is unique. But this. How many times have you seen people do this,\nor you do this? Are your rolling your lower back in the gym\nwith a foam roller? If you are; stop! As of today, stop. It's one of the worst things you can do for\nyour lower back and I'm going to explain to you today exactly why that is. Now, the foam roller is a great way to mobilize\neither your spine, or to mobilize soft tissue if you use it the right way, but you'd better\nstop right about the level your thoracic spine, or mid-back, ends. There's a reason why. If you look at Raymond here, I'm literally\n– he's mobile today. I got him off the rack. If you go here and you look at the spine you've\ngot your cervical vertebrae up here, and then they go into your thoracic vertebrae that\ngo down through your mid-back, and then they go into your final five lumbar vertebrae down\nhere. But if you look as I spin him around you'll\nnotice one thing. What's missing where I'm holding him? There's no more ribcage, right? When we get down to the lumbar vertebrae there's\nno more ribcage here, coming off, or at least articulating here with these vertebrae. So it's sitting in here, and floating, versus\nup here, I've got all that support. That's what happens. When you foam roll in this area here you've\nnot only got the shoulder blades that can disperse some of that force as you're pushing\nforward – and I'm going to show this to you in a second – but you've also got the\nribcage that's pushing back on the anterior push here of the vertebrae. So you've got this counterforce which creates\na really stable column for you to be able to, basically, do whatever you want. But when you get down here there's nothing\nsupporting it and when you press in this area, notice the lumbar spine is already angled\nforward here. It's in this Lordotic Curve, is what they\ncall it. So it angles like this. So if you start pushing into that, especially\nif you don’t know what the hell is wrong with your back, and creating that in the first\nplace; then you can be creating a hell of a lot more problems. So let's go down to the floor here and I'll\nshow you why. Okay, so here we are now, down on the floor\nand we're going to see an action why rolling the lumbar spine is a really bad idea. If we go back a step and we talk about the\nthoracic spine we said how it's actually good because we have all that extra support that\ncan disperse that force and what we can do is help to get extension because we don’t\nhave it here. Most of us are too far rounded forward in\nthe mid-back. We don't have the ability to extend. So by dropping our weight over the foam roller\nwe can get into extension and it works out perfectly. In the lumbar spine though, we're already\nin this curvature forward. That's the natural curve of the lumbar spine. So when I put this in here, and I get in there\nmore it actually could be devastating if you don’t know what the hell is causing the\nreason why you're doing this in the first place. If you're stiff, if you're tight and you think\n\"Oh, I need to roll it\", well, what if you had something like stenosis, which is a narrowing\nof your spinal canal and you start forcing yourself into extension? That's a really bad thing to do. Or if you had a spondylo, which is a fracture\nof one of the side portions of the vertebrae. You don’t want to be going into more extension. That's one of the worst things you could do. So all of those things could cause pain and\ntightness that radiates away in the low back, and you're sitting there rolling it away,\ndoing exactly the worst thing you could be doing. Beyond that though, because you don’t have\nthat support, even if you tried to do this, your body is naturally going to try to resist. So your abs are going to tighten up because\nyou don’t want to go into all this extension. So your abs are going to be basically trying\nto tell you \"Don't roll that area! Hold on! Don’t let go, Jeff!\" And we're thinking that we're doing good things. It's not good. The majority of what you want to try to fix,\nif it's stiffness, if it's tightness, if it's things in your lower back; remember what I\nsaid before? Don’t look in your lower back, look somewhere\nheels. Look in your hips. Look in your quadratus. Look at your glute medias. Those are all things that you can roll out\na lot more effectively, way more safely, that can help to unlock whatever tightness, or\nthings you're feeling in your lower back. I've got some stretches, I've got some things\nthat we've used with a lacrosse ball, and I'll link some of those in the description\nbelow, other videos that address those areas. A lot smarter approach than just trying to\nbang away with a foam roller here. So promise me this: as of today you'll no\nlonger, ever, foam roll your low back. Upper back? That's fair game, but down there? Don’t do it. All right, guys. I hope you've found the video helpful. Make sure – this video came as a response\nto the people that requested this after I mentioned it in one of our previous videos. So if you have any other questions, or you\nwant me to cover any other things make sure you leave them in the comments below. In the meantime, if you're looking for a program\nthat shows you the right way to do things, and also tries to guide you away from the\nthings you shouldn’t be doing – not because I'm trying to just continue to make a list\nof things that you shouldn't do, it's just that there's a lot of bad shit that people\nare doing that I think they need to know about, or they're going to wind up doing more harm\nthan good. Guys, you can find that in our complete training\nprogram – ATHLEANX – over at our ATHLEANX website. In the meantime, we have a program selector\nwe've created. If you click the link below that will allow\nyou to figure out which of our many programs best fits your goals. It takes just a couple minutes to go through\nit over there. All right, guys. I'll be back here again soon. See you."
