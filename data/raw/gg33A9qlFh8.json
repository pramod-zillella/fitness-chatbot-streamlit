    "transcript": "up go whatever they can follow up okay yeah but it's gonna it has to do with the video anyways it lets through the video I'm almost done with my brand new epic intro but I wanted to ask you a questions can i play my old intro in this video because let's face it he's a video get millions of views I want that one to get a lot of views I can't believe I just you just ruined a midway through this whole workout just see I gotta go do this again well it's not like you don't have a couple pounds to lose baby guy what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we're talking all about the lower abs a matter of fact we're doing more than talking or I should be working we're gonna do a lower ab workout together and I say lower abs because you actually can influence them you can't just isolate them in an ab workout because that's not how our muscles function but I can't influence them if I choose the right exercises that move the bottom towards the top that take the legs as your external resistance and move them towards the top and I have a way to get you guys to do this right every single time we use our 6-pack shuffled I include with all of our workout programs and again I have the option of sort of going after my entire core which we've done in the past here even on YouTube or going after a specific area now in this case we want to kind of hit that lower ab region that's what this is all about at this point I could choose whether or not I want to use any equipment I want to keep this simple I want everyone to be able to do this I want just my own bodyweight and then in terms of my difficulty level let me keep it at level two it's gonna be challenging enough for most of us and I'm telling you by the time this thing is over it's pretty damn brutal so what we do is we shuffle it up and when we cope with this workout and this is just six minutes now I want to take you through this and you're gonna go through it with me and feel all the pain so this starts here with a figure eight then we're gonna do for thirty seconds you can see the rotation here the bottom up movement definitely targeting the lower abs then we have our hands back raise there's gonna be done for 60 seconds then moving the bottom towards the top we have something more explosive for 60 seconds this is a twisting piston definitely incorporating the rotation that also helps to engage those ABS and then we have our rest period much needed at that point we come back with some seated nav circles once in the clockwise direction once in the counterclockwise direction and then we come back and finish up with last two exercises a scissor V up here for 30 seconds now we're kind of bringing together both the top and the bottom and then finally one of my favorites the 21 crunch right leg left leg and together and we're gonna do those in a circuit so without further ado guys it's time to get started welcome to 30 seconds Jesse you ready figure Eight's there we go and we start making our 8 and every time we come to the top lift with the pelvis off the ground clear your tailbone yes am I done yet we can do this six minutes come on oh man all right I heard 10 seconds all right just like this lift and crunch okay yeah try not to lift with your legs try not to use your hip flexors for all these moves instead try to crunch yourself towards your legs okay meet in the middle I got a tip for you want to do it Jesse you done now for the year thirty Seconds no sweat no pain no pain okay guys I'm already burning so if you're doing this and you're feeling it it's normal he's doing good yo yeah all right explosive [Music] so we rotate in and wrote to the out what's it in it out these are fun actually I need a 30-second rest coming if you have to rest drop to your knees and resume as quickly as possible we pause this thing it is hard it's not easy 19 seconds hang in there so listen abs like I said do not have to be done over the course of a long time they just need to be done consistently I like to train abs every day very briefly five six seven eight minutes no more round around of course oh they're having some problems man I gotta go the other direction for a minute - you do it it helps if I close my eyes and I imagine myself you know not here somewhere else blend my happy place in the gym oh wait that's right oh yeah now I gotta go other direction see if I wasn't a camera right now I'd stop no really trying to dig in here and use my abs even though they're tire to make sure my hip flexors are driving the movement [Music] time 3000 man yes I did a little harder to get up this time [Music] [Applause] no way one two three two three oh hey I couldn't make it one two wait what oh man hmm I am mortal so I'll shoot from down here why are these more difficult anything else because our lower abs tend to be a little bit weaker number two we actually are again waiting every single movement because we have to lift with the weight of our legs whereas our top-down movements are far less weighted have far less resistance so all these exercises stacked up become very difficult however you now have like 6 my game plan for you to start working on your abs your lower abs and it gives you a measure of progress here if you add a staff a few times so what so you can get through it and work your way up to the point where you don't have to stop at all alright guys if you're looking for this exact tool if you want it we include it in all of our athlean-x workout again daily have work ass short brief but intense is what I recommend is how it's going to get you the best results you should include with all of our programs in the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments thumbs up below if you're going to do this multiple times and follow along with me let me know how you do in the meantime if you haven't done so please subscribe turn notifications so you never miss a new video when we pull it out Jessie get down here's your turn [Music] you"
