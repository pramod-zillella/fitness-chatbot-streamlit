    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere at the next.com today we're going to talk all about the best dumbbell bicep exercises for you now i've put together a video in the past where i selected exercises for the biceps with dumbbells but they were based on your training goal whether it be hypertrophy power or strength or even just a corrective exercise but this is different a lot of guys ask me jeff you're the science guy let's put the science into our selections so we're going to do that anatomically and functionally if you look at the biceps here you see we have two heads the purple area here the short head on the inside black area on the outside here the long head more responsible for the peak we have the brachialis that sits underneath here which provides some width to the bicep and then we have the one that we don't want to forget either which is a brachioradialis that also has some attachments as it crosses the elbow so what would the best exercises be for those that's we're going to do here in this series guys one by one area by area exercise by exercise all right so the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna look at the long head of the biceps and again that's that outer portion here that is responsible for the peak and the height of the biceps and the two things that you want to look for in your exercises is that either it's placing your arm back behind your body or that the outside portion of the arm is more visible when you perform the exercise if we talk about the anatomic position of the elbow behind the body what that's doing is it's placing a greater stretch on the long head because of its attachment in the shoulder joint so as we get back behind the body we get more of a stretch and get better recruitment of the long head the other aspect that i mentioned was the outer portion being more visible well what you're seeing is what you're training when it comes to the biceps if i see more of the outside of the arm when i'm doing an exercise then we're gonna be training more of the lateral outside head of the biceps so that being said guys let's start breaking down the exercises that are best here for the long head all right so the first exercise up here is the classic dumbbell drag curl and as you can see it gives us that great opportunity to get the elbow back behind our body and to keep the dumbbell close throughout by simply dragging it up our body the goal here is to make sure that the elbow never drifts out in front of you right keep it all the way back as far as you can and try to get that dumbbell as close to your shoulder at the top as you can it's going to feel like a tight squeeze but that's what we're going here for guys a good contraction with a focused effort on the lateral outside head of the biceps all right so the second exercise here is actually the dumbbell incline curl and it's going to ensure that you do it right because the bench itself is going to put your body in the right position to make sure you do see if i lean back here into the bench and i just let my arm hang down you can see that right away relative to my torso my shoulder here is into extension taking care of that prerequisite of having the arm behind the body for better long head recruitment but from here i can also do something else if i want to enhance the stretch i've shown you guys before i could just contract the triceps at the bottom to simply inhibit the biceps momentarily to get a better stretch and then rebound more forcefully out of that bottom position for a better contraction either way it's the bench itself that's putting you in the position to succeed here just make sure you don't forget to include it when you're trying to hit that long head of the biceps exercise number three here gives us an opportunity to hit the long head of the biceps with a little bit more weight because we can actually perform something a little bit more compound in nature and it's called the row curl so what we do is we have a pair of heavier dumbbells and we actually place them next to our feet with our feet here close together and what we're trying to do is initiate what we call a dead row but we take over halfway not by simply pulling the dumbbells up with a rowing motion but pulling them up more with a curling motion but as we've seen here now in these three exercises the position of the elbow in relation to the body is the same it's still back behind the body as we perform the exercise allowing us to better hit that long head of the biceps remember heavy barbell curves are not the only weapon in your arsenal when you're trying to train your biceps heavier your dumbbells can do the same thing and this exercise here gives us a chance to do that while at the same time more effectively hitting the long head of the biceps the last exercise for the long head of the biceps is called the dumbbell weighter's curl now i've covered this one before in fact it was jesse's favorite exercise and the only one he did for his biceps for 30 days if you want to get gains from this exercise you can do them but you gotta now focus on the other thing i told you about and that is what portion of your biceps is visible when you're doing it if you do this right you're gonna see more of the outer portion of your biceps because this is a long head exercise designed to help build bigger bicep peaks the goal is to simply keep that top portion of the dumbbell flat parallel to the ceiling and the floor throughout the entire exercise you're simply lifting it straight up and straight down in order to be able to do this you're going to want to make sure that you bend your wrists backwards as you come up this is going to minimize the contribution of the forearms from taking over and dominating the movement and placing all that stress on the biceps at the place where it matters the most at peak contraction right up at the top if you don't feel like your biceps are going to absolutely pop at the top of this exercise then you're not doing something right aim for that squeeze that uncomfortable squeeze and i'll tell you that's where the real gains are had so when it's the inside of the biceps you want to train more effectively and build more width on the arm then the short head of the bicep should be in your sights the way to do that is not just to choose exercises that allow you to more visibly see it like we talked about but you also want to make sure you can maximally contract it and to do that you have to pay attention to the three functions of the bicep it's not just flexing the elbow and supinating the forearm but it also has the ability to place that shoulder into greater flexion if we can choose exercises that do at least two of these three things while also revealing that inside portion of the bicep then we're gonna have some winners so that being said here's the exercises one of my favorite ways to hit the inside portion of the biceps is with a simple standing dumbbell curl but we can do something different here to more effectively overload that second component we mentioned that is supination of the forearm see if we offset the dumbbell in our hands this way up closer to our thumb then what this wants to do is pull us down into pronation well we can see that when i perform the exercise i'm not just curling the dumbbell up by flexing the elbow but i actually have to overcome that tilted dumbbell that downward force into pronation by actually supinating so i'm getting more resistance into supination more effectively hitting that short head of the biceps the next exercise here for the bicep short head is called the dumbbell spider curl and we're using the bench once again to our advantage but this time instead of laying our back against it we're laying our chest against it because what we're doing is we're placing our arm in a position where we maximize those three positions that we talked about we're getting resistant elbow flexion we're getting resistant supination and because the shoulder is out in front of our body and elevated into slight flexion we're getting an overloaded bicep contraction in shoulder flexion so we're hitting all three components if we were doing a regular curl and standing upright we would actually lose some of the tension on the biceps at the top not with the spider curl we're actually shifting that peak tension away from the mid-range and placing it on the biceps in its most contracted state this right here is a way to get great gains and to direct them most effectively at that inner short head of the biceps which brings us to our third exercise here for the short head and that is the biceps preacher curl and once again it's the bench that's coming in and setting you up for success here because it's getting your arm out in front of your body and it's also eliminating the momentum that you might get from swinging your arms back and forth when you perform the exercise here though there's one thing i want you to focus on and that is the target of the dumbbell where is it heading towards you don't want to come across your body and head towards your chest what you want to do is at least bring it up towards your shoulder or even better more to the outside of your shoulder because it better hit the short head we want to have more visibility of that short head if i were to close it down you wouldn't see it if i were to open it up you would this is where you're going to be able to hit that area more effectively if you do this exercise properly next up is an exercise that you probably have never done before but it's actually just a variation i don't see the dumbbell curl but instead of letting the dumbbells hang down to start we actually start them right here from our lap and what this does is it effectively removes some of the contribution of the brachialis and the brachioradialis which we're going to get to in a minute and it places more of the emphasis on the biceps as a whole what we are getting here is that overload on the elbow flexion the supination and at the top here the opportunity to do that extra right that shoulder flexion so we initiate without momentum from the thighs and we get it to the top and then get that extra little press once again driving those elbows out in front of our body and more effectively hitting that short head which brings us to our final exercise here for the short head and that is the no money curl you might be asking where does he get his name from so as you see me do the exercise you can see that i am getting that clear invisible activation here of the short head of the biceps but more importantly for me i also like the fact that i'm getting some good external rotation at the shoulder you can never get enough external rotation and this curl is one that actually reinforces good improper posture you can't go wrong when a curl is also reinforcing good posture this is one of my favorites we throughout this video now to bring you some miscellaneous exercises not necessarily geared towards more of the long head or the short head activation but just good selections that are based on controlling or taking advantage of momentum the first of these miscellaneous exercises is one that i love and it's called the dumbbell strip curl and instead of using a bench to help us out here we're using a wall to make sure we get this right and you can see here that the goal is to take the momentum of a curl away now in some instances as you're going to see soon it's actually a great thing to take advantage of some momentum if you want to work a different aspect of the curl but we want to make sure that the biceps themselves are doing all the work and muscling us up on every repetition then this is what you want to do you take that momentum away by forcing your upper back and your butt to stay in contact with that wall throughout every single repetition the urge is going to be to either bring your butt away from the wall to swing it or to lean down and take your back away from the wall neither of them are allowed you need to make sure that these are done in proper form and with the most precise control and with that it brings us to the evil twin of the strict curl and that is the cheek curl or the eccentric curl and you can see here that the goal is we're trading in all that control and precision for the overload we get eccentrically with a cheat curl so i like to do two things here number one i like to do one dumbbell at a time we've discussed before that in a standing curl if you lift two dumbbells together that the exercise becomes infinitely harder and it's more difficult to lift heavier weight well here we want to try to get as heavy a weight as we can actually lift so that we can overload the eccentric knowing that we're stronger on the way down i'm utilizing momentum and swing just to put it in position to give me that next eccentric rep and from here i want to slow it down and control it all the way down to the bottom and last up in the miscellaneous category it doesn't matter how you try to restrict me in terms of using only a dumbbell i'm always going to find a way to do one of my favorite exercises for my biceps and that is the weighted chin up and that's exactly what we're doing here i take a dog leash and i wrap it around the dumbbell like this and then i simply wrap it to itself and then hang it around my waist it's effectively a bodyweight version of a curl but instead of curling a bar up i'm curling my body up to the bar but the other thing i like to do here too is something we just covered and that is overloading the eccentric and all i have to do is just step myself up to the bar and then fight that descent try to slow myself down as much as i can if i get down to the ground step myself back up again and repeat ultimately i'm going to lose my body's ability to control myself on the way down and when that happens the exercise is over but it does give us a chance to take her with the type of stress that we're subjecting our biceps to with the dumbbell in an exercise combo that you might not have thought of before or even tried back to the areas of muscle focus here guys no bicep development is complete without the inclusion of exercises that target the brachialis this muscle is the one that lies underneath the biceps and helps to create more of that width and girth in the size of your arm so if you're looked out from the front the width is going to be exactly where you want to be the exercises to get that done are the following and we start here with the cross body hammer curl you can see that instead of just bringing the arms up directly in front of our body with a traditional hammer curl we want to bring it across our body because by doing so we have to pronate the forearm and face it down towards the ground if the biceps is a supinator of the forearm we can minimize the contribution of the biceps by getting into pronation and once we do that elbow flexion the bending of the elbow is going to be primarily driven by again in the beginning portion exercise mostly by the brachialis so this exercise here gives us the opportunity to work one side at a time focus on getting that good contraction and squeeze of the brachialis beneath the biceps and at the end of the day help to build up the width and girth of that arm from any angle now if you want to go to the more traditional approach of bringing your arms up in front of your body in a more traditional hammer curl then try this variation out instead it's called the robot curl but what we're trying to accomplish here is just to increase the tension that we apply to the brachialis in its most challenged position at that midpoint of the range of motion so we start with our arms in this position and we simply lower one down come all the way up through the curl and stop it again in the mid-range so while we were working the other arm we were obviously still isometrically challenging the brachialis on the non-working arm the idea here is it's the perfect complement to the crossbody hammer curl when it comes to dumbbell exercises it's that slight variation that increases the time under tension that's going to give you just that added push you need to start seeing some new growth in your brachialis and then we finally move our focus down the forearm a little bit and stop right here on the brachioradialis this is another one of those muscles that you do not want to overlook if you're looking for maximum arm development just because it resides primarily in the forearm doesn't mean that it doesn't still contribute the visual effect that you're looking for when you're trying to develop bigger arms and here the exercise of choice once again involves offsetting your grip but this time with the pinky sliding closer to the end of the dumbbell to give us a better chance to target the brachioradialis because we know as we bend our elbow up we can actually more favorably overload that pronation that the brachioradialis is trying to accomplish and by shifting that pinky down towards the end there we're getting that offset load that helps us do exactly that at the top we want to squeeze as hard as we possibly can make sure you're doing these each and every repetition under control really trying to force the bulk of the work right here into this portion of the forearm if you do this exercise properly you should actually see the muscle stand out of the tension and pop up you know just sort of to remind you that it's actually doing all the work so there you have it guys the best dumbbell exercises for your biceps what are you doing my part oh you know i just wanted to kind of show off my biceps so there you have it guys the best dumbbell exercises based on the area it is that you're trying to focus on and improve and if you're looking for more of these videos and you find them helpful
