    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com so if you have ten minutes here today I promise you one thing I'm gonna help you to annihilate your shoulders you're welcome the thing is I'm actually gonna give you a choice of how to do it you can pick your poison you either go the heavier route or the lighter route you see because I get it you're training at home maybe you don't have all the options either at the gym but I don't have huge expectations here all you need to have is either a pair of light dumbbells or a single heavier dumbbell a lot of us have that it's kind of just sitting in the closet break out either one and I promise to get you to the same end point and that's like I said annihilated shoulders in just 10 minutes so that being said I want to start breaking them down the path whichever one you choose get ready to work all right so let's start off with that lighter route when I talk about letter by the way we're qualifying it these are not absolute terms lighter is lighter than the heavier I'll and heavier is heavier than the letter out if we were going absolutely heavy then we'd be trying to train for strength and our rest periods would be a lot longer and the goals of our workout will be different we're going for hypertrophy and we're using what we have at our disposal which is that lighter or heavier option so for those lighter weights here's what you're gonna do you can do one exercise here for 45 seconds on 15 seconds off and immediately repeat a second round of that okay then you're gonna perform as you see here five total combinations for a duration of 10 minutes and what we're trying to seek out here something called metabolic overload and it's beautiful that we have these quick short little rest periods because it's going to enhance the effect of the metabolic overload you do you're 45 seconds of rest you get that brief rest just to shake out the burn and you bring it right back again see if you can get through another 45 seconds of this is it tough yes is it capable of delivering hypertrophy yes so you might as well pursue it guys and push yourself through it as much as you can what are the exercise options well we start right here with our first one the one and a half mile raise where we're really trying to get a focused contraction of the delt to lift the weight up and not just to lift it but to control it half way down and then back up again zero momentum we forced the middle delt to do the work here and that in and of itself is probably a new stimulus that allowed us aren't used to remember two rounds of this we move on to the next exercise which is the H raise so here I'm just using a chair as a prop and I'm using it as a target to force me to stay at a certain height here and make the front delts continue to work throughout every single repetition so I raise up the sides of the chair I have to come over the top when my delts are working their hardest to maintain that long moment arm i shorten it for a brief second go back out to that long moment arm back to the sides and back down again remember repeating this for 45 seconds on a brief 15 second rest and another round you move on to the third exercise here and this is the w race so now we're shifting to focus a little bit more to the rear delts and when we do here out of a kneeling position is simply allow our arms to come back behind us where we're trying to let the thumbs beat the elbows alright we're trying to let the hands beat the elbows keep the elbows down as low as you can if you can see when you come around the side here that this creates a W with the arms and what it gets is additional external rotation at the shoulder so not only are we hitting those rear delts but we're also hitting the supporting muscles namely the rotator cuff that makes this really an effective exercise especially again if you're not hitting these muscles often enough the fourth exercise and this worked out is something we call the Urlacher now this one I'm doing sitting on the edge of a chair but again you can do this one from a kneeling position as well it starts off as a little bit of a bicep hammer curl but it quickly turns into this external rotation side lateral raise combination it feels much different than the W raised simply because the position of our body has changed and because of that the impact it has in the middle delt is more pronounced as opposed to the rear delt but either way you're going to feel this one with a tight contraction at the top and again 45 seconds on 15 off two rounds before we wrap up here with our final exercise in this 10-minute workout and that is with the kneeling speed press now this looks rather easy now this would be rather easy considering you're probably a hell of a lot stronger than the light dumbbells you're pressing overhead but when you add the speed component you add the power component to this it becomes much more difficult 45 seconds yeah sure you can get through it 15 second rest but you're going through the second round you kind of gasp it for a little bit of air here and wishing you could stop don't do it finish out the workout strong guys this is a quick and easy way for you to cycle through this to blast those shoulders without needing very much weight at all now for those of you out there that are looking to go the other route and use the heavy dumbbell I got something for you too just ten minutes also the goal here is that you're gonna perform each of these exercises for one minute and earn a one-minute rest period that means two minutes per exercise you're gonna work your way all the way down until we have something special for you save up on the very last minute of this workout but the goal is to use a heavier dumbbell and to actually share the load between the two arms by performing those things that can be performed in alternating fashion and alternating fashion so that we ensure that we're getting around 10 or 12 repetitions on each arm throughout the duration of the one-minute period if you do have to rest in a period keep it to a rest pause get right back at it and make sure you're working for as much of the one-minute period as you can first up in terms of the exercises is the cheat lateral raise so here we're actually capable of taking advantage of the heavier weight to get a little bit of extra momentum to get that way up and then force the 'center control of the weight on the way down remember we talked about alternative ways to stimulate hypertrophy eccentric muscle stimulus is one of the best ways to do it so we're trying to control the descent of that dumbbell and switch hands each and every repetition right arm left arm one minute on when you're done you get a full one-minute rest we move on to the next exercise and that is the alternating single arm clean and press so you take this one all the way down to the floor explosively clean it up to your shoulder press it up overhead back down switch arms and continue to do this both sides now with this being a slightly longer exercise to perform each and every repetition you might get a few less reps but don't worry about it the key is high effort for the entire one-minute the third exercise up here is the alternating single arm high pull so instead of bringing it up and actually pressing it up overhead now we're just concentrating on the pull portion bring it all the way up to shoulder height the key thing I want you to focus on here is the position in the relative position of the elbow or relation to the hand and wrist the elbow is lower than that this is not I repeat not it never will be in upright row you don't want the elbow traveling higher than the wrist like it doesn't an upright row instead when we do this and we flip that around and have the wrist higher than the elbow we've got actual external rotation instead of internal rotation and elevation on the shoulder which is much healthier and a better option and still capable of delivering those muscle gains that you're training for so here we move on to the fourth exercise and that is the gravedigger so we kneel down and we simply bring the dumbbell up to that shoulder press up and over remember you're sharing the load here now by being able to split the weight in the load of the weight because you're holding on to it with two hands at this point in the workout though this is conveniently timed to still be able to deliver that stimulus of overload because it's going to feel a lot heavier than it is because you're already four exercises deep one minute on here and woman it off and you come to our last dumbbell exercise here and that is the dumbbell press out and this one's great because we're taking an advantage of the fact that we can lengthen and shorten the moment on that dumbbell by extending your arms out or bringing it closer to your chest when it's closer to your chest you have a bit of a reprieve you don't feel the full way of that dumbbell because of that shortened moment arm still allows you a brief rest before you have to press it back out again you rep it out this one for 45 seconds because see here you get just a 15 second rest before you have to do the last thing here in this workout and that is a final burnout get rid of the dumbbell drop down to the ground do this bodyweight push away press see me last every grueling second to the very end and if you do you know wind up like I am here on the floor you see doesn't matter which way you go which poison you pick the end goal is that your shoulders are fried here in just 10 minutes proving yet again that is not how long and you train for it's what you do in the time that you train that matters if you're looking for workouts that optimize the time that you train so you don't sit here and train for hours and hours on end without necessarily getting the results that you want to see the head to athleanx.com because we show you
