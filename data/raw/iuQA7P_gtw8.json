    "transcript": "What the hell is that? \nThat was my audition for   People's Magazine's Sexiest \nMan Alive 2021 Edition.\n  And you thought the winking was necessary?\nThey wanted sexy, didn't they?\n  Man, the more things change, \nthe more they stay the same. \n  What do you mean stay the same? I ve got \ngains, I look fantastic in my new clothes. \n  I was not talking about that when I'm actually \ntalking about guys, by the way, what's up, guys,   Altheanx.com, Jeff Cavaliere. See you got me \nall flustered it s not even the right intro.   The fact is, I covered the video years ago that \nwas the five best exercises for men, according   to women. And that was basically what you should \nwork on to develop your physique according to what   women want. We're a lot more progressive here at \nAthlean-X. We're going to open up our standards   to who finds who attractive. I'm just saying, what \ncan you do to make yourself more attractive? Well,   guess what? The more things change, the more they \nstay the same a poll across my desk the other day   where they identified six muscle groups \nthat you should develop if you want to be   instantly attractive in clothes.\nOkay, so looking like me, right?\n  Well, listen, I know you're ready for a date \ntonight, and I know you're reaping the rewards of   finally sticking to a program. But we're going \nto take the six areas that we need to focus on   and then fill in the gaps with the best exercises \nyou can focus your attention on to develop each of   those areas. And guess what? \nWhat?\n  Because you show up to work on time \ntoday and because you dress the part.\n  Well again, for a hot date.\nWe're going to let you identify what your   favorite exercises are in each of those areas.\nOh, okay, great. I love to start. \n  So, let's start from the top down. \nOkay. \n  Easy enough traps.\nTraps. \n  How do you develop your traps?\nAll right. Well, first off, I love the   deadlift. It s my compound lift obviously \nto start with. It allows me to weight up   really heavy and it really gives me that \nisometric contraction on my traps.  \n  So, good heavy load, isometric contraction up \nthere you obviously move some heavy weight.   Great. Next, what would you do if you \nneed to be a little bit more dynamic?\n  To be dynamic? Power Shrug, absolutely. \nBecause it allows me to lighten the weight   up a little bit. But again, it's a more \ndynamic movement and allows me to get,   you know, use a little more momentum. \nSo, you get a little bit momentum into it, so it's   not just a static contraction of the deadlift, \nbut a little bit, but still heavy weight. \n  Exactly. \nAnd then the last one is   actually when I introduce you to.\nOh, I love this one.\n  It's the Trap Pull Down. So, guys, if you haven't \ntried this, you go to a pull-down machine,   you take a narrow grip, lean forward \nand pull straight down and back.   You really feel an intense contraction on the \ntraps, and you've been using that one, too. \n  Yes, I have. \nAll right. So,   we keep it going down the line here. Next stop is \nat the shoulders. How are you developing yours?\n  Obviously, again, starting with the compound \nlift, and that's a heavy overhead press.\n  Okay, so we go from the overhead \npress, the obvious one to, I would say,   another obvious one here too.\nDo you want to round out your delts,   so I hit the side lateral raises \nbecause again, it hits the side   delts and makes me look bigger in my sleeves.\nBigger here. This is growing by the second, I   think as we re speaking here. Especially now that \nyou re on stage. The next one, the Face Pull. So,   we want to round out delt development we're going \nto get the rear delts too. We've got the Face   Pull, as you so perfectly demonstrate here. \nOh, I love this one.\n  All right now, let's keep it going. \nSo, the next stop is the arm,   so we want to fill those shirt sleeves. So, \nwhat are you doing here for your arms?\n  First, I start with curls.\nOkay, so I actually like the   alternating dumbbell curl because you \ncan focus one arm at a time here. \n  Yeah.\nAll right. \n  I go next to the Waiter s Curl.\nOk, so the Waiter s Curl again,   something that I actually usually take credit for \nas the exercise that gives me that biceps peak.   But I showed it to you, and it's the one that you \nfell in love with over that 30-day period. \n  Oh, yeah, absolutely. \nOkay, so next we have what those are two for   the biceps, Jesse, what are we doing here?\nWell, curls for the girls.\n  Okay, she's your insufferable. \nWhat do you got next?\n  Next up is Lying Dumbbell Tricep Extensions.\nOkay, and what are you looking for here?\n  So, it hits the long end of the triceps, which \nis great because it makes up the most meat of   the triceps. And obviously your triceps makes up \ntwo thirds of your arm. So, to really fill out the   sleeve so you really want to hit those triceps.\nLook it, you re listening, you're picking   up notes, you're doing it in \na pretty good job so far.\n  I m learning. \nNext up again, we move now a little bit inward,   the chest. There's no doubt that if you get a \nbigger chest here that stands out prominently   in your shirts, you're going to be making a \nbetter first impression. What do you do here?\n  Bench press obviously. Again, compound movements, \nguys. It's my favorite one to start with.\n  So obviously I don't think we're unearthing \nanything really mystery like here,   but we're trying to make sure that you're \nhitting the big basic exercises, focusing   on building your strength there and then filling \nin the gaps. The bench press, whether you do it   with a barbell or dumbbells, is going to get \nthe job done. So, what's the next exercise?\n  Low to High Crossover.\nAll right. So, with the low to high movement here,   you guys know that I love the abduction-based \nmovements for chess. If you go from low to high,   you're following the fiber direction \nof the upper chest a little bit more,   which would be a good complement to \nthe bench press. And then finally?\n  Finally, is dips, you know, very easy movement, \nbut you know, it definitely hammers the chest.\n  You like to weight them. \nAlways. \n  Okay, so if you're able to weight them, I would \nsay weight them to take advantage of the overload   here. If you're not and you're still doing \nbodyweight, just take them to failure. And   again, don't go so low that you jeopardize your \nshoulders. Now we go to a little bit lower here   now at the waistline. We're talking about. \nOh okay, so.\n  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, \nno. See, I knew it wouldn't take long for you to   get juvenile with this video. \nOh, okay.\n  So, we're going to keep that buckle, we're \ntalking about the waistline here. Did you   feel that? So the waistline and what we're \ntalking about there is obviously developing   your midsection. So, what are your favorite \nexercises to do to develop your midsection?\n  I start with the Dumbbell Power-Up. That's one of \nmy absolute favorite ab movements of all time.\n  Okay.\nIt s explosive. \n  Good explosive, upper ab driven exercise. \nWe're going to go lower abs here. What's   your next favorite exercise?\nHanging Leg Raises.\n  So, I love the hanging exercises, guys. \nThey're more difficult because you have   to lift the weight of your legs. Make sure \nyou're doing them properly by curling your   butt under and not just lifting your legs up.\nAnd one added benefit is, you know, grip, strength   and forearm size from hanging on to the bar.\nThat's true, too. And if you're going to roll your   sleeves up like you do, I don't know whether it's \nfashionable or not. It's at least going to benefit   you there, too. The last exercise here \nis one that I actually introduce you to.   It's the Gymnast AB Tuck, twist when you get the \nlittle additional oblique action here, right? \n  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. \nSo, do you know what my favorite   waistline exercise of yours is? \nWhat s that?\n  Ditching the gummy bears. \nOhhh.\n  That really is the thing that's going to have \nthe biggest impact on the waistline. But let's   talk about the exercises, because that's \nwhat the poll was talking about. Finally,   we're going to hit that last area beneath \nthe waistline and we're talking about?\n  Now this time.\nNo, no, no, no, not this time. We're   talking about the backside. \nOh, glutes. \n  I think he'd be disappointing many people, we \nsaw you in that exercise fail video If I have,   if I have to put that up again here. \nAre you saying that blurred is generous?\n  Yes. So, you have now the glutes. \nNow this is your wheelhouse.\n  This is my wheelhouse for sure.\nWhat are you doing here?\n  Squats, squats, squats. It's \nmy favorite exercise.\n  So, and building up to a pretty impressive \nsquat at this point too, I would say.   Moving around to the next exercise is?\nBarbell Hip Thrust. I actually love this   exercise because it not only engages my \nglutes, but it gets my hamstrings as well.\n  Cool. And then the last exercise is one of \nmy favorites, and it's one of the bodyweight   ones. Not everybody has access to the machine, \nbut it's the Glute/Ham Raise. It's training   the glutes and the hamstrings to work together, \nright? So, you have to engage the glutes first   and then allow the hamstrings to contribute. \nIt's a great exercise, especially for athletics,   for preventing hamstring injuries because you \nare prioritizing glute activation that leads in   and supports hamstring activation and development. \nSo that's your list, Jesse. You actually made it   through the entire list. \nYeah. \n  Without really, truly screwing this video up. If \nyou guys like what he did, you can actually leave   your comments below and see if you want more. If \nyou like the way he's dressed, if you have some   pointers, maybe to help him out, make sure you \nleave those also. But when it comes down to it,   guys, you have to make sure that you're not just \nlooking the part here, but we always say, yeah,   you want to train like an athlete to look like \nan athlete and feel like one, but you also always   have to then be able to actually perform.\nOh, talking about performing, you know,   that's a big, big, big aspect \nof, you know, the dating life.\n  Did I mention insufferable?\nYes. \n  Anyway, if you're looking to put it all into one \n90-day plan, guys, which Jesse congratulations   once more of actually following a plan for the \nfirst time. You see what happens when you do?\n  Oh, you look great. \nYou can get them over at Athleanx.com. If   you like the video and you found it helpful, leave \nyour comments and thumbs up.
