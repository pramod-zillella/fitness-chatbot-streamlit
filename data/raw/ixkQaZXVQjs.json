    "transcript": "What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nToday we continue our perfect workout series   and this one's all about the beginners. I \nhave a perfect full-body workout for you   that's going to take you through step-by-step. \nI'm going to give you exactly what you have to   do. Not actually just for a couple of weeks, \nbut for three months, I want to make sure   that you get this right. That being said guys, \nlet's start breaking down 10 essential movement   patterns that every beginner must master. \nOkay, so it s not only important to understand   that there's these 10 movement patterns that you \nhave to master, but within the movement patterns   there's some exercise variation that we're \ngoing to build upon. We're going to take them   from level 1, to two, to three and the difference \nbetween these levels is either the complexity of   the exercise or the amount of weight that you \ncan use to load on the exercise because it's   going to be important to make sure you're pushing \nyourself forward in both of those cases. \n  So, what does it look like? Well, the first \nmovement pattern is something we call the   Horizontal Push. This is where we use the \nshoulders, the chest and the triceps to do   a movement like, let's say, the push-up at \nthe most basic level. And I like the push-up   as a Level 1 variation because it demands \nthat you build some scapular controls with   your hands placed firmly on the ground. \nWe move from there though to a Dumbbell Bench   Press. We take away the ground as something that \ncan assist us to building that stability and we   now have to have that stability ourselves. \nThe good thing about using dumb bells is   that because they can float freely, if you have \nany start imbalances between the right and left   sides, you're going to see it here. Because \nwhen we move to Level 3, when you perform   the Barbell Bench Press if you have those \nimbalances there, they can kind of be hidden   because both hands are placed on a fixed bar. \nWe move on to the next movement pattern and this   is the Vertical Push. And here we're talking \nmostly about the shoulders and the triceps,   overhead pushing activity. We start with a 1-Arm \nDumbbell Press, it's easier to move with one   arm at a time because, again, you can look for \nthose imbalances between the right and left side   and there's less core control that's demanded \nof you by using just one dumbbell at a time.   But when we step it up to Level 2, we now have \nto push both of them together. Again, additional   weight being moved over your head requires more \ncore stability and control, but we're going to get   to that if we progress the right way. \nAnd we move to Level 3 here and that's,   once again, where we incorporate the Barbell \nOverhead Press. You have to now move your body   around the bar as opposed to the Dumbbells around \nyour body which increases the complexity, but you   can also load this exercise even heavier. \nWe then move to the next patter, the Horizontal   Pull. So, now we're talking about biceps and back, \nwe start with something called the Chest Supported   Row. When we get in this position, we don't have \nany demands on our low back strength to be able   to do the row, we can focus on our ability to \nget stronger and develop those pulling muscles.   We can take away that support though and move in \nLevel 2 to a Tripod position. And here you still   have a little bit of support, you're not having to \nsupport your entire body and space with your low   back, but you have minimized that level of support \nand increased the demand in the weight used here   on your pulling muscles. And then of course, \nwe can move freely at Level 3 to the Barbell   Row where now you do have to have that support \nand strength of the low back to keep your body   in the right posture and position to be able \nto pull, in this case, heavier weights. \n  We then move to the fourth position here and \nit's the Vertical Pull. And we know that the   base level here is we're talking about something \nlike a Pulldown and if you have access to a   Pulldown machine, you can honestly weight \nthis to a degree that's able to be done by   even a very rank beginner with light weights \nbeing used. Or, if you don t have access to that,   you could simply use a band over a pullup \nbar and do a banded version of a Pulldown.\n  When we take it to the next level, we're \nobviously being able to get ourselves to be   able to do Pullups. So now we use a band \nthough in an Assisted Pullup situation.   This band is going to unweight your body from \nanywhere from 50 to up to 80 pounds depending   upon the resistance of the band that you're \nusing. Of course, our goal is to ultimately   get in Level 3 to your ability to do Pullups \nthemselves without any assistance at all. \n  Which brings us to our movement pattern and \nthat is the Hinge. And it's not about pulling   with your upper body at this point but learning \nhow to pull with your Posterior Chain and hips,   because they're some of the most powerful \npullers in the entire body if you learn how   to do it right. So, what we do is we start with \nsomething here called a Pullthrough at Level 1   where we're simply focusing on hinging back at \nthe hips and then using powerful hip extension to   drive yourself back to a vertical position. \nAnd we take it to Level 2 here with an RDL,   not having to take if fully off the ground as you \nwill in a Deadlift, but simply learning how to use   those hips in an abbreviated range of motion \nto get through that powerful hip extension. Of   course, as I mentioned all ready, Level 3 takes \nit to the floor to one of the best exercises we   can do and it's the Deadlift, the gold standard \nof Posterior Chain strength and development. \n  Which brings us to the next movement pattern \nand it's the squat. Here guys, we're talking   about your ability to move your body up and down \nin space. And of course we're going to start with   a variation of a squat, it's the Dumbbell Drop \nSquat. The thing I like about this more than any   other, is that it will actually teach any beginner \nthe exact place their body should be in space when   they perform the squat because the dumbbell will \ndrop right down through the center of gravity   and take your body into the right position.\nBut we simply can't load that heavy enough to   progress forever. So, we have to now learn how \nto bring that dumbbell up in Level 2 to a Goblet   position. It's a bit more challenging, but you \nhave to be able to control that up there as well.   Which is a perfect transition to Level 3 \nand it's the classic Back Squat. And here,   of course, we're going to be able to use the \nmost amount of weight while still staying true   to the mechanics we use on perfecting \nthe squat with the lighter weights. \n  Now the seventh and eighth movement patterns \nare actually related. They're a variation on   the Lunge. And as an Athletic Strength Coach guys, \nI can tell you right now, the Lunge is one of the   most overlooked but beneficial movement patterns \nthat you need to master. We start with a Static   variation, we're just going to move our body up \nand down in space, similar to a squat, but with   one leg out in front of the other. And we start \nwith a simple body weight Split Squat. Unweighted,   remember the complexity or the weighting of the \nexercise determines which level we're at. \n  To take it to Level 2, we actually now add \nweights in the same Dumbbell Split Squat position,   working each side obviously, but going straight up \nand down and building the strength in our Quads.   And then we take it one step further, to \none of my favorite exercises of all time,   it's the Dumbbell Bulgarian Split Squat. \nAgain, working one side, but certainly we   can increase the load that we use here and \nthe challenge on the front leg as well. \n  And then we want to add some movement to it and \nthat's where the Dynamic Lunge variation comes in.   At Level 1, you're looking at, again, a Biweight \nsituation when performing a Reverse Lunge. I like   the Reverse Lunge because it's more forgiving on \nthe knees if you have any current knee issues.   We then take it to Level 2 where we add a single \nDumbbell to the situation here and we do a   Single Sided or a Suitcase Reverse Lunge. \nThis is good because it's going to demand   increased stability of your hips in the \nfrontal plane while you still perform that   Saddle Plane motion. Of course, we can add \none more Dumbbell to the equation in Level 3   to perform the heaviest variation and it's \nsimple the Dumbbell Reverse Lunge. \n  We move on to the ninth movement pattern \nhere guys and it's a Core Flexion move.   Realizing that the flexion of the spine and the \nrotation of the pelvis are crucial to learning   how to contract your abs properly. We're going \nto start with something very simple in Level   1 with a Rollup. This is a Pilates movement that \nteaches you not only how to get up off the ground,   but to control that segment by segment as you \nlower yourself back down to the ground. \n  Which brings us to Level 2 where we now can \nperform something called the Jackknife. And   with the legs now kept off the ground, we have \nsome additional weight challenge because the legs   themselves are going to provide that. At Level 3, \nwe have something even more difficult which is the   Hanging Knee Raise. Which now demands that your \nbody can be controlled while hanging from a bar,   we're trying to curl the pelvis and \nnot just simply use the Hip Flexors   and lift the knees up. \nThen finally we have the Carry,   which is another one of those overlooked movement \npatterns, but no less important. Guys, you have to   learn how to build your grip and hand strength \nand be able to dynamically move it in space.   We start with a Suitcase Carry at Level 1 \nwhere we have a single Dumbbell at one side,   of course you're going to be working both \nsides. We move to a Farmer's Carry where we have   a Dumbbell in each hand now which is going to \nobviously increase the amount of load that you're   carrying around. And then we move to the third and \nmost challenging of these and that is the Overhead   Carry. Once you get those arms up overhead, \nlike I alluded to back with Press, there's a   lot more core demands placed on your body. \nHow do we work our ways through these levels   and movement patterns so that you have \nthe exact plan that you need to follow?   Well, we start with our first month of training \nhere and it's divided into three workouts: An A,   B and C. The A and B workouts are your \ntotal body workouts and are performed in   alternating fashion on Monday, Wednesday and \nFriday. So, you're going week one, A, B and A   and in week two B, A and B and you'll repeat that \nthrough weeks three and four. The C workout will   fall in the days in between on Tuesdays and \nThursdays throughout the entire month. \n  So now with those 10 movement patterns, how do we \nsplit them up over the course of A, B and C. Well   we start with A and in A here we start with the \nSquat movement pattern, followed by the Vertical   Push, the Horizontal Pull and then the Lunge, \nin this case the Static Lunge variation. \n  In the B workout, we have the Hinge, the \nLunge, this time done Dynamically, the   Horizontal Push and then the Vertical Pull. \nIn the C workout, we actually pair together those   last two that I mentioned, the Core Flexion \npattern and the Carry movement pattern. \n  What does that mean now for Level 1 specifically, \nwhat are you going to actually follow? Well,   we have those movement patterns again broken down \ninto those three workouts and the exercises that   we drop in here are those Level 1 exercises. Each \nof these exercises is going to be performed for   three sets to 12-15 repetitions to Form Failure. \nOr, to Form Failure alone on the body weight only   exercises. Now the goal here guys, is to build \nup your ability to perform and master these   movements, it's not about loading the weight \nyet that's why the rep range is higher. \n  And you might say to yourself, \"But I already do \nBench Press\" we're taking a step back here guys,   we're only talking about six workouts over the \ncourse of this month. I want to ensure that you   learn how to build that foundation once again from \nthe ground up to master these movements to set   you up for nothing but success down the line. \nSo, each of the workouts shown here can do exactly   that for you and prepare you for the next month. \nWhich brings us into month two. In month two,   now we increase the Level as well to the Level \n2 exercises. The structure is going to stay the   same. We still have the same grouping of the \nmovement patterns, except this time with the   change in exercises we have new workouts. So, now \nwe have D, E and F, with D and E being those total   body workouts done in alternating fashion on \nMonday, Wednesday and Friday. And then we have   those core and carry workouts done on Tuesdays \nand Thursdays. With the Level 2 exercises now in   place here guys, you can see as I drop them in the \ngoal has changed a little bit transitioning away   from just building that foundation to now actually \ntrying to build strength upon that foundation. And   the reps and sets will change as well. The reps \nare going to drop down to the eight to 12 range,   picking a weight that you fail within that \nrep range but still can complete every single   repetition you do in good form. Also giving \nyou the option of adding an additional set here   to build upon that volume as you continue to build \nyour experience in these movement patterns. \n  Which then sets us up for the success as I \nsaid, at Level 3. So, now in month three guys,   you actually can do this for longer than a month. \nTalk about a video that keeps on giving here guys,   I wanted to make sure that our beginners out there \nhad something to follow where they could make the   best gains and experience the most success \npossible. We built that foundation up and   now we're going to break it down again, one more \ntime, with the H, G and I workouts, still broken   down with the same grouping of movement patterns, \nbut now we introduce those Level 3 exercises. \n  And what you're left with in these Level 3 \nexercises are the traditional Barbell exercises   that you can perform for strength in three \nsets of five or three by eight fashion. The   idea being to build that foundation of strength \nnow on that really stable foundation that you've   taken the time to rebuild from the ground up. As \nyou perform these exercise guys, if you could do   the three sets of five, you want to make sure \nthat you continue to add weight, progressively   overload these movements. You would do that by \nadding five pounds to each workout on each lift   if you are able to successfully achieve the \nthree sets of five in the previous workout. \n  If for some reason you didn't get all three \nsets of five, then you would repeat the   weight that you used the previous workout. If \nonce again you failed, you maybe overshot the   weight that you chose, you drop that down by \nfive pounds and repeat until you can master   all three sets of five. And traditionally the \nweight you're going to use here guys to start,   you're going to pick a weight that you know \nyou can perform the five reps for but is still   going to challenge you. You're always going \nto be able to adapt them as we go based upon   the success for failure I just mentioned.\nAnd with that guys, you've got a step-by-step   game plan. As always I'm leaving the screenshots \nhere for you to take and make sure that you can   follow this plan step-by-step. And where \nwould you go from here? It really is up to   you guys. If you want to continue to build \nout that strength, you can certainly stick   in that third phase here and in that Level 3 \nand continue to add weight and do that. \n  If you want to shift your goals and you want to \njust focus on building muscle, whatever it is   guys, I've actually got step-by-step plans that \ninclude nutritional game plans as well all over   Athleanx.com.
