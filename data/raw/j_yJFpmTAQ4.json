    "transcript": "what's up graduate cavalier athleanx.com so if you want to grow bigger biceps i've got something that you can do every single day to make it happen now look if the list of things that you're doing every single day because you've been watching my videos is growing exponentially long well maybe you're gonna have to make a cutter too but if you're looking for big biceps this is one you're gonna wanna keep because this tip is something you can start doing like literally right now now i'm gonna tell you a little story first this dumbbell that i hold in my hand is the basis for why this tip works believe it or not this is the first and only dumbbell i had access to as a kid this is a five pound marcy dumbo it was actually the only dumbbell my brother allowed me to use when i used to tag along in his workouts he was four years older than me he would say here take this and don't hurt yourself well i didn't have a lot of options in terms of the exercises i could do with this but i certainly did a lot of curls now i'm not going to say that doing a lot of five pound curls at the age of 11 was what allowed me to build bigger biceps that's not the case what was true though was i was able to build and develop a my muscle connection because in order to make this five pound dumbbell feel like i was actually doing anything i had to learn how to actually contract it through space see not just move it from point a to b but contract it see i pretended that on every single rep that i did somebody was asking me to make a muscle and to do that i had to really squeeze as hard as i possibly could when you translate that into every rep that you do you get better just like anything else with practice comes the ability to do something better and what happened was i carried that over into the two exercises that i really did the most of growing up barbell curls with a heavy heavy focus on the eccentric portion and the chin up and i made videos talking about my success with these two exercises the minimalist approach worked for me but it only worked for me because i had the ability to recruit my biceps very well and if you're missing that right now and you are doing your curls or you are doing your chin ups and you're copying what i was doing and it's still not working this is the reason why so the good news is you can fix that you don't even need this you can actually drop this entirely what you need to start doing is learning how to contract your arm through space making a muscle while you do it your ability to either make a muscle uncomfortable when you contract it or not it's actually really important when you flex your arm like this do you feel any discomfort at all because i do i feel as if it's balled up and actually very uncomfortable and when i start to increase that by supinating the forearm as well i actually increase that discomfort and that's a good thing it's a good sign and when i can raise my arm up in deflection a little bit more knowing that the long head allows me to do that and i get more of a contraction and more discomfort than i'm really on to something and this has actually been backed up recently by my friend dr andrew huberman from stanford who shared with me some research that's being done that shows that your ability to create discomfort in a muscle while you contract it is an indicator of your ability to grow that muscle that's really exciting stuff but again we've been doing it for a long time so how do you increase your ability to do this with practice and daily you don't have to do this really guys in a public setting matter of fact spare me from doing it in public setting because it's going to make you look a little bit weird but what i want you to do is just learn how to actually contract your arm in space so a few times a day four reps is all you're going to need to do for about 10 seconds of peace and what i want you to do is just learn how to move your arm through space as if someone asked you to make a muscle so bend your elbow and squeeze and turn and really try to create discomfort here and if you can't don't worry about it just try again and if you can't then just try again and as you accumulate reps and reps and reps over time again four is enough for the day guys but when you do this over time from day after day you're going to improve that my muscle connection that is very important to taking it back to the exercises that you're doing and as i said here guys it's something that you can do with no weight at all but when you do get back to your weights and you do have a better mind muscle connection every single exercise you do every curl variation even the ones that weren't working for you before those big barbell curls and those chin ups as well they'll start working too and i promise you guys once you have that in place you'll never look back make sure you let me know how it feels do you feel it at all when you contract your muscle now if not it's okay tell me about it because there was a point in time where i didn't either but you can get over that if you do the right things if you're looking for a program guys you can find it over at athletics.com
