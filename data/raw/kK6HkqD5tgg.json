    "transcript": "what's up guys chief cavalier athletics.com today i'm going to show you something you can do between every single set no matter what you're training for to get better results from your workouts and there's one thing we know that we all have to do regardless of what we're training for that's we're going to rest between the exercises in our workout right and it's going to vary and that is for strength it depends on what study you've read these days but you're resting either between three to five minutes to optimize your output realizing that the bigger compound list when you're training for strength are going to require a higher effort level we're gonna require a better recovery so you're gonna rest longer some people say even as high as seven to eight minutes between efforts in order to maximize your output and i've actually witnessed that firsthand myself as i'm sure you have and some people who do competitive olympic weightlifting will actually wait between sets of a power clean eight to ten minutes because of the precision required to get that right but there's variability okay and that's an important point to point out hypertrophy on the other hand if you're looking to just grow muscle regardless of what is happening to your strength levels is going to have different recommendations you've probably seen recommendations of 60 to 90 seconds or a little bit longer two to three minutes and that's the difference between the exercise you're performing even if you're using a barbell row for hypertrophy that's going to have a different impact than let's say a one arm dumbbell row in terms of the overall impact on your recovery and your ability to come back and perform the next set so the rest times might vary depending upon the exercise itself and then some will even say something as short as 30 to 60 seconds and before you throw that recommendation out you have to realize that hypertrophy can also come through different mechanisms and we know that utilizing metabolic fatigue using higher rep totals like 20 reps and resting just 30 seconds in between sets can create a incredible demand on your metabolic fatigue and stress which will give you another form of hypertrophy so there are variations in what this recommendation is depending upon again what you're training for and on the other side here we have conditioning and whether or not you're performing exercises in a hip fashion or whether you're lifting a barbell in a complex or whether you're just doing a circuit here again rest times are going to be different 15 to 30 seconds between completed rounds of a circuit or a hit workout transition rest only between the exercises itself right instead of just the end of those circuits what's happening between the exercises or let's say 60 seconds max at the end of a complex so we we define the fact that everybody's resting but the one thing that you need to do regardless of who you're listening to and what recommendation it is that you're going to follow you better be doing this you better be timing your workouts right we have our timer app on our phone it's free and if you utilize your timer app you'll have a precision to what it is that you're trying to follow here because if there's one variable that gets overlooked more than any others it's time we track how much weight we're using we track the number of sets we're performing we track what wind you know what direction the wind is blowing in you know the humidity in the room we have everything written down in our journals but we don't talk about our rest periods and what i want you to do is at least when you're starting out or at least if you haven't done in a while just to make sure you remain focused on what you're trying to do start timing your rest periods and do that every single set now what happens here there is variation within a workout if i have let's say i'm following a four minute recommendation for strength if i follow four minutes and i time my four minutes but i realize that at the end of the four minutes as the workout goes on i'm not recovering enough to give a good effort in the pursuit of new strength then i'm gonna expand that it's not supposed to be a fixed level but you have to be cognizant of where you're heading it's too easy for us to jump on instagram and just become so distracted that four minutes turns into seven and if you were following this protocol it would actually be detrimental to your overall progress now i'm not actually against the use of instagram in between sets because it is going to be a long period of time here but utilizing the timer app is something that actually keeps you honest and it's incredibly important again because as a variable in terms of overall progress your time between sets matters and it matters a lot so my recommendation is let's say you're training for hypertrophy and you're going into the two to three minute range let's say because you're using a bigger more compound lip for hypertrophy if that's the case there you have either two choices set the app for two minutes sort of the minimum time frame then you determine when it goes off whether you need a little bit more or you set it for the maximum time frame and if you feel ready prior to the time the alarm goes off you just jump back into the exercise right but you're going based on feel and that's going to change as the workout proceeds because of your overall cumulative fatigue and whatever exercise it is that you're performing but do me a favor from now on guys make sure you time what you're doing because it matters it is just as important as all the other variables in your workouts and it's the one that's most likely being overlooked right now if you're looking for workouts guys where all the variables matter we lay them all out step by step for you they're all over our athletics programs the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know also i'm going to cover i'll do my best to do that for you if you have already done so guys make sure you click subscribe and turn on notifications so you never miss a new video when we put
