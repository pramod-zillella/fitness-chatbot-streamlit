JEFF: I’m just taking the dumbbells. JESSIE: Uh, yeah. I'm using these. JEFF: All of them? JESSIE: Yeah, all of them. Jeff! I'm using that, too! And that! JEFF: You know what? Forget it. I'm going to go ride the bike. JESSIE: Whoa. I’m using that, too. JEFF: Hey, Jess. Can I work out here with you? JESSIE: That's my last rep. It's all you, bud. JESSIE: Shit! Dammit! F***! F***!

I've got some great advice for you. I read this article online. It's going to work wonders for you. JESSIE: Hey, Jeff. I have a quick question. On the video that we're doing right now, do\nyou want me to put just a regular transition there, or do you want it to be a fade, a dissolve? What? Just, simple? All right, man. I'll catch you later then."
