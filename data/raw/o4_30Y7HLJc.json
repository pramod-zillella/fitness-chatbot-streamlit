    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we're going to look back in time old school back in time like like this old school back in time to help you to develop your abs because there were things that these guys were doing back in the day that you should still be doing today as a matter of fact if you're not I think you're missing out on your ab training I actually followed this exact thing the universal bodybuilding magazine and I did the ab exercises there and a lot of them still make the cut today so I'm going to break them down for you one by one and show you exactly think I should help with this what are you doing what is what are you talking about I see come on man it was Jesse on both all of you Eugene the third what is this the mustache oh I think the mustache looks fantastic for my style oh my god you know you did you have any try to do its 20/20 I think that Jesse fellow had one and if I recall 20/20 is 365 days so he's got 364 more days to do that would you mind if I did my video please I'm gonna go through these exercises sure I'll be waiting over at the first exercise for you there guys like it or not you asked for it he's in it with that said exercise number one alright first exercise up is think dragon thrust I like this exercise as a stability exercise and it's directly opposite the plank for a good reason so if we come up here hands behind your head anchor yourself somewhere Bartholomew good okay so so you put the legs and you start them into the chest and you shoot them up or out so this is going to be easier for someone that's starting out if you're a bit more advanced you're gonna be able to get them and shoot them out at that angle there but what's missing here you need to be able to lift through the glutes to stabilize here so as this is up you need to drive up with the glutes in the opposite direction that's what makes this exercise difficult but it makes it much more valuable than say the plank which actually has the glutes a bit on rest so you want to make sure that when you do this exercise again start off at the top if you need this and then slowly lower yourself down here so you get the east-central work on the abs or if you're more advanced you come up you shoot about that angle there lower lower lower lower lower and you hold it there you lower yourself down long like that without overextending barth all of you oh that was very tough next up we're gonna hit the abscissa exercise number two the abscissa and you're gonna have to pull your arms down you know do this in due time I will the abscissa and to get in position to do this exercise you have to have your arms behind your body on the bench is that my cue that's your cue okay back like that you recline your body down right into that position there your legs are straight down towards the floor and you're gonna lift one up at a time here good definitive squeeze and down other side good definitive squeeze and down you can continue to alternate this back and forth the the beauty about this exercise that's long sort of overlooked is number one it doesn't necessarily place the same strain on the lumbar spine that maybe some of the laying down exercises do that require your legs to be straight because when you get down to the end if you're not strong enough to hold it you might go into a little bit of extension keep doing the exercise the last thing that you know here that we see here is a benefit is that in those exercises when you do lift your legs up towards the sky when you get to the very top you actually lose a lot of the resistance on the ABS in the very top position in this exercise you don't even at its highest range here you've actually got peak tension or almost peak tension on the lower abs here making it a great exercise choice the next exercise here is you might be surprised to see the Jessie Bartholomew could I talk to her please sure this is the seated broomstick twist you've probably seen this way back in the day there's a big change that I want you to make if you're gonna do this right it's not about simply twisting as fast as you can like that okay enough it's about feeling this way you're supposed to feel it in which this should be targeting your obliques the way to do this is to position yourself on the edge of a bench here and then get into posterior tilt and do something that I don't tell you often to do and that is to round out the thoracic spine to create a little bit of kyphosis because when we do when we get in that position here we're gonna limit the amount of rotation we get with the rotation we will get will come from the thoracic spine as opposed to trying to force rotation as a lumbar spine especially for high repetitions or for long periods of time so if we get in this position we recline just a little bit he's rounded here he's posterior tilted here that's what I want you to do look straight up and then in here now you're gonna try to squeeze right here into the obliques in almost drive your elbow from this side to this thigh and then from that elbow down to this thigh so tie the side we climb back a little bit more round out there you go you might have thought you could get I don't know two minutes worth of twisting the other way you might only get 10 to 15 twists total do it this way so the key here is though you were doing it right and you're not damaging your spine in the process try it this way and I promise you going to see more from it next exercise is going to be the single sided dumbbell carry exercise number four I mentioned the single sided dumbbell carry one of the hardest things you can do for your core to challenge it is to simply pick up a dumbbell but just one because if you pick up - you're gonna balance yourself up I just noticed Jesse we're having a standoff and who's got better adductor flexibility I wouldn't say it's Jesse but it's definitely Bartholomew so we pick up one dumbbell and all you have to do is walk around with it watch what happens when you do this is a pretty heavy dumbbell Bartholomew will pick it up in one arm and we see right off the bat that in order to stabilize and keep these shoulders level that this side here has to contract as if he allowed this thing to take over his whole body would drop in this direction of the weight instead he's got to tighten up this side over here really learn how to stabilize and strengthen and then we add some dynamic movement to it by simply having him walk this way where you going so you want to walk around and do carries I heard that dumbbell drop as long as you possibly can without actually just allowing the dumbbell to drop keep those shoulders level maintain a stable pelvis maintain stable shoulder positioning and walk as far and as long as you can and last but not least right here the captain's chair is something that does not mean remedial or at a lower level it means you can focus more on the ABS and they knew this and they did a lot of their work here on this device this is why because instead of having to focus on holding on to the handles of a bar and do hanging leg raises that we're hanging knee raises or any exercises you see Bartholomew doing here you can focus on the ABS because all the support was being born here through the forearms and we can do things like this oblique twist we can do things like this the bicycle raises we could do things like a simple knee raise here or a straight leg raise if you're a higher level the fact is you're going to be able to get more quality repetitions out here because of this device taking the demands off of your grip as the weak link and putting it all right here where it's supposed to be on the core so there you have it guys there are five moves that maybe you forgot about a long time ago but I won't let you and I want you to start incorporating them again and the good news is not only we see good results from doing those but we also all don't have to see this anymore because oh would you rather see this classic at [Music] Jesse Jesse yeah can you go work on your intro please yeah dude house we use the moustache anyway classic exercises guys make sure you put in the use it as a matter of fact I appreciate the classics I actually appreciate the new way we should train ABS how we can improve ab training there's so many other functions that the ABS are responsible for a lot of times controlling movement and not even allowing it in the first place and we need to train all of those I actually have developed them in a complete ab training system that's available at athlean-x and January 6th in the meantime like all of our programs guys we're looking for a way to put the science back into what you do so you can get better results from your training that's what we do here at athlean-x all of our programs available at athleanx.com found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know if so we're
