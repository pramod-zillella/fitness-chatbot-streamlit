    "transcript": "Oh what's up what's going on here oh I did have been working on my ass muscles recently and they look great so I figured I'd be taking all the ass yeah no Jeff listen I know it's called the gluteus maximus you're a physical therapist I thought you knew Anatomy I'm familiar with that yeah do you know what Latin is do you know gluteus maximus means it means most is and portentous the muscle is you're ridiculous sure hey you know what they hand out gym shark memberships and sponsorships for pictures like this and I want one what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we're going to talk about how to develop your glutes I'm actually going to show you one exercise that I feel is super effective for doing that and regardless of whether you're chasing sponsorships like Jesse or whether you're a high-performing athlete because I will tell you right now I see it from both sides as a strength coach and as a physical therapist if you want to be a high-performing athlete you have to have good glute development and matter of fact it's critical to optimal performance whether you're trying to do anything explosive jump run fast you need to have a good development your glutes strong glutes I'm gonna show you an exercise that will do that from the other side of it interestingly as a PT I do know my muscles Jesse in the names and the Latin origins of them I will tell you this that many of the things that we deal with low back pain tightness is through the hip all these compensations that we get often times sometimes even hamstring poles come from having weak underdeveloped glutes you cannot strengthen your glutes enough this exercise is going to do it and I'm gonna actually say it's I guess sort of my equivalent of the face bowl for the upper body to pull through all right I like it just as much for everybody that's keeping score at home this is called the pull through so you anchor a cable down low ropes yeah you're gonna have to fight the people that are doing the face pulls at the ropes for this but you anchor the rope down here low with the cable machine or you use a band if you're training at home you anchor to something behind you this setup is critical this angle here is critical okay you're not standing straight up because you actually lose your balance you're gonna have to almost angle your body this way just because of the force of the rope pulling you back that way your hands stay right there in front of your groin okay right there they're just resting now all he's gonna do is allow his hips over here to hinge as his knees drop straight down into sort of like a deep squat he's gonna he's gonna keep his angle of his body a little higher sit a little lower right there okay now the hands drop all the way through to the other side not because he forced them through there just because the weight pulls him there now when he comes up nothing changes here the angle of the body stays he just comes straight up from there all right straight down sink deeper chest up and come up good yeah you'll feel the glutes do all of the work down up through here straight through just like that you don't come all the way up to the top from here right you are he is he is through full extension because his body's angled this way he doesn't come all the way up and try to like reestablish himself come back here one more time so hands down straight down sink deep load the glutes out hinge at the hips now all the initiation is right through here up squeeze right to home alright you will feel that contraction at the top if you do it right every single time now why is this so beneficial I talked about it in other videos guys one of the main things you could do if you're having a problem with your squat is you've got to learn how to stop creating segmentation of the different parts of your body where you go down and then the top starts to move before the hips do goodmorning the bar you're good more in the bar oh you have to move everything together your chest and your pelvis should move together if you learn how to drive from your glutes that will happen if you don't you're going to start to lift with your low back first and then your glutes kick in when they're able to contribute more because they're weak I went through a whole video that I'll link at the end of this video where I tell you how to actually recruit the glutes a little bit better prior to squatting to get that same effect the second thing I'll tell you is a lot of times people think that when they squat their squad square that everything is sort of set up properly but they're actually twisted in one direction of the other they're open on one side the hips are open to the right or the hips are open to the left because of the imbalance is when you squeeze your gluts everything actually squares off so the more you learn how to recruit your glutes not only is it going to directly create a better-looking and much more developed blue they're gonna actually contribute to all the other glute exercises you're doing like your barbell hip thrust like your squats like you're deadly so this exercise guys is something you should do often work it into your leg training program if you're trying to chase the sponsorship you'll get one a lot faster if you incorporate the pull through and as I said you don't need to just use a cable if you don't have access to one you could set up a band put around your waist and anchor it back behind you and do the same thing the idea is just follow the mechanics of dropping through I'll demonstrate it one more time to show and through here again I have my hands right there in front of me okay I'm angled at that position here slightly forward I drop straight down right there straight down now from here I'm not trying to pull this through I'm not going my arms through I'm straight down and now what I do is I just stand straight up all through the glutes the hands will drop down and through only because the weight is pulling them I come up straight through hands stay right there body never changes just like that that's a properly executed pull through that's going to get those glutes of yours more develop though you're looking for programs where we show and kind of walk through the detail of how you need to perform every exercise because it matters
