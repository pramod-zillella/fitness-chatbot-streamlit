    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nJesse Laico, Athleanx.com.\n  Today we're talking about how a \nskinny guy built a bigger chest. \n  A big chest. \nA bigger chest. \n  Big chest. \n--er. \n  Big.\n--er.\n  Big. \nOkay. How to grow your chest.   And let's face it, he looked like this before, and \nthere's no denying the fact that Jesse has grown   his chest. I want to share with you what exactly \nhe did, because we can learn from everybody. Let's   go into the mind of a skinny guy and help these \nguys out to see exactly what you did. All right,   so if you want to start building a bigger chest, \nthen you need to start at least understanding the   difference between these two steaks.\nOh, those look delicious.\n  You really are becoming the \nLiver King, aren't you?\n  No, like I said, I don't \neat baloney sandwiches.\n  Well, actually, what you see between these two \nsteaks is a difference in size. One is about   a 12-ounce steak, and the other one over here is \nlike a six-ounce steak. Clearly, there's more meat   in the 12-ounce steak. And if you want to build \nyour chest up, you better start learning how to   pack on more meat to your chest. And the way to do \nthat is by relying on that big compound lift. And   when it comes to the chest, we're talking about \nthe bench press, something you did more of.\n  Exactly. The bench press, which \nis obviously not my strongest lift   compared to my squat and deadlift, which are \npretty impressive, if I do say so myself.\n  They are impressive, I won't lie.\nI did increase the frequency of how much I   was benching through an A/B/A structure, which is \nin our Old School Iron Program, which you can find   at Athleanx.com. \nNice plug. \n  Thank you. And I found that by increasing \nthe number of times I was benching from,   let's be real, zero times a week to 1 to 2 \ntimes a week, depending on that split. \n  Yup.\nI found that I was getting more progress going   with especially my strength and then how much I \nwas able to progress with weight on the bar.\n  So, for those that don't quickly \nunderstand the A/B/A structure,   if you put your bench press in your A workout \nand did it on Monday and Friday, A/B/A the B   workout would be Wednesday, you wouldn't be \nbenching. But in the next week it goes B/A/B.   And you mentioned one time that week, so it's one \nor two times. Then you did something else too.\n  Well, the other thing I did was I \nadded in some bodybuilding movements,   some accessory exercises.\nLike you see here.  \n  Which I found to be extremely helpful with the \nfact that when I stalled on my bench press,   which happens pretty often.\nYeah, a lot of people   will have that happen, yeah.\nI found that it was still a good avenue   if you really go through different movements \nthat would allow for more chest growth. \n  Yeah. Well first of all, other than the bench \npress allows for a complete chest contraction   in a lot of these cases \nAdduction.\n  --through all these exercises, adduction. And \nalso, it gives you the opportunity to use more   hypertrophy techniques.\nYeah. \n  Because let's face it, progressive overload, while \nimportant, is only one hypertrophy technique. And   when building a bigger chest is the goal, you \nneed to explore all of them. So eccentric focus   exercises here, the ability to perform some of \nthese for higher reps for metabolic overload,   but not discounting the effectiveness of \nthose other techniques and the ability   to incorporate them with the power \nbuilding approach was really key. \n  So, the next thing you want to do, if \nyou want to build up that skinny chest,   is you're going to want to bump up the angle \nof that bench, do more upper chest work.   Did you know that your body actually sort \nof has a growth limiter effect built into   the upper chest fibers? In other words, if you \ndon't train them enough, the sternal head is not   necessarily going to continue to grow because it \nhas an effect on the biomechanics of the shoulder.   Having both heads equally developed \nis going to be very important. So,   what do we do? We bump up the ratio of upper \nchest work to lower chest work because we tend   to not get enough focus on it, as is. \nJesse, you did a lot more of that.\n  I did. I did for every one flat chest \nexercise or lower test exercise,   I was doing two upper chest exercises.\nSo, what were some of your favorites?\n  Some of my favorites were the Low to High \nCrossover, which I thought was an awesome   exercise. And I was able to move a little \nbit of weight with it, which was pretty good,   and I get a really good contraction. Next \nwas the Incline Dumbbell Bench Press,   which I love as an exercise because again, \nthat allows me to move a little bit more weight   than I would with the cable exercise.\nAgain, going back to what we said in the   beginning, if you did two workouts for \nyour chest in a week, you'd be benching   with the incline twice in both workouts. \nBut with the flat bench you did once. \n  Yes.\nOkay.\n  So, then another exercise that I really love to \ndo was the Upper Chest Pullover. I developed that   kind of chisel at the top, you know.\nLittle inverted heart shape, right.\n  And another one that I love to do was \nthe Decline Pushup as one of my metabolic   exercises as we talked about before. \nRight. So, in the last part, we talked about   exploring all the different avenues for growth. \nWell, the metabolic options here as a pushup   is great because you could do the higher rep \ntotals. But of course, if you switch the angle   to the decline, you're actually ironically \nworking more of the upper chest. \n  Yup.\nSo, you've got to focus on that upper chest. Don't   just look at it as an afterthought, make it a key \npart of your approach to building a bigger chest.   All right. So, we talked about adding more meat, \nwe talked about adding more to the upper chest.   What about if you just want to kind of \nbroaden that chest out, get that bigger,   wider chest? You do have to realize that there are \ntechniques that we can incorporate that help this   along. And for me, that's full range of motion.\nFull range of motion for sure. I found that   especially on exercises like the Dumbbell Bench \nPress, getting the dumbbells all the way down,   you know, touching the outside of my chest and \nmaking sure I'm getting to that good stretch   position. Especially on a Crossover too, you \nknow, when I got my arm all the way back,   could I go back another half an inch, maybe \nan inch more. And when I did and I realized,   yeah, I could get a little bit further \nback, I did get a greater stretch on.\n  Again, any muscle that you want to develop \nthrough a full range of motion is going to be   more developed. You have to take it through \nand apply that tension through the entire   range of motion that it allows for. It's not \nunlike any other muscle group, guys. The chest   is also responsive to stretch tension like the \ntraps are. Or even the calves are responsive   to stretch tension. But here you just have to be \na lot more mindful of getting yourself there. \n  Yeah, and it kind of demanded a \nlittle bit more of a focus that   I wasn't kind of putting there before.\nRight. So focused effort through all the   exercises that you're doing, but that full range \nof motion is definitely critical. And that brings   us to technique number four and actually pairing \nup hand in hand with what we just talked about.   If you want to make sure you get into full range \nof motion, then give yourself a chance to assess   whether you're through full range of motion. \nAnd the best way to do that is how?\n  With a pause.\nRight. If you could just   pause at the bottom of the rep, you get a chance \nto say, am I in the position I need to be and if   I'm not, it gives you that chance to adjust.\nExactly like on the Dumbbell Bench Press when I   get the dumbbells down to the bottom of the rep \nor give me a chance to assess just for a second,   am I deep enough and if I got enough stretch \nthere? And then I d be able to press from   there. Or like on a Dip when I can get to \nthe bottom and really assess where I'm at.\n  Yeah, I mean, and that's the thing like with \na Dip too, you don't want to go too low. I've   talked about so many times going to low on a \nDip places too much stress on your shoulder.   So it even gives you a sense to be able to \nkeep yourself in a safe position at about of   that exercise. One more you did, too.\nThis one is actually one of my favorites and this   is the High to Low Crossover. \nRight.\n  I found myself, when I got to the top of the \nrep, I found that I was really getting a good   stretch. And when I paused there, I was able to \nreally, you know, lean forward just a little bit,   get an extra bit of stretch on it.\nAnd this is something that you actually   do almost in every one of your chest workouts. \nAdmittedly so. It s one of my   favorite chest exercises of all. \nHe just likes the way he looks in it guys. So,   you obviously get the additional benefits of the \npause reps too. You get more time on retention,   you get more focused strength from the muscle \nyou're trying to build. You take away momentum   when you use pause reps. So, for all those \nbenefits, you're going to want to make sure   you incorporate them as well. \nAnd I found that they were \n  Were you going to say something?\nOh, I was going to tell a hilarious joke.\n  What was it?\nWell, it's not   really appropriate for camera, so proceed.\n  When you're a skinny guy, you can't build your \nchest it can be very frustrating, right, Jesse?\n  Very frustrating.\nDoing the right things,   though, can help you to unlock more growth \nif you're looking for how to actually solve   that lower chest problem where you kind of don't \neven have any line down here at all. We have the   lower chest solution you're definitely want to \ncheck out. If you're looking for a program like   the Old School Iron one that Jesse did, you can \nfind it over at Athleanx.com.
