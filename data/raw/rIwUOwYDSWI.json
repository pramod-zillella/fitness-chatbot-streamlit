    "transcript": "[Music] so this workout is something i call the dumbbell death march and all you have to do is pick a single set of dumbbells if you're a beginner choose something on the lighter end let's say 10 pounds or so if you're intermediate you'll be picking something around the 30 pound range again give or take 5 or 10 pounds and on the higher end here the more advanced guys are going to pick something up around 50. the goal this workout is to complete four exercise combinations or rounds as we call them at the beginning of each round we're always going to start with the same exercise and that is this dumbbell death march now if you don't have a lot of room at home and you want to do this in place you can do it like this but if you do have the room to travel then you're going to allow yourself to actually walk and travel forward as you do your renegade rows in both cases you're going to perform five repetitions on each arm which leads you right into the second half of that combo and in the first round trip we start with a dumbbell thruster the key here i like to just aim my elbows directly down and i let them touch my knees at the bottom of every rep and i drive out of there we're working our shoulders our triceps our upper chest our legs it's a great exercise to hit our entire body after 40 seconds i take my dumbbells i walk back to the beginning and after a 20 second rest i start my next round trip and waiting for me at the end of the second round trip is the dumbbell sprinter lunge so here i pick up the dumbbells and i just simply step backwards and i love that posterior chain by simply tilting my torso forward at the bottom of every rep again 40 seconds is all i'm looking for here and i pick those dumbbells up and i walk them back and i wait 20 seconds on the third round trip now we're going back to the upper body again and this time we're doing this variation of a push-up i'm bringing the dumbbells in really close to my body to accentuate the triceps but i also get the chance to squeeze my hands together as much as i can so i get that extra engagement of the chest remember we could just passively push ourselves up or we could squeeze up and get a lot more chest activation if we do it this way so i do this now for 40 seconds now if at any point in time you can't do the entire 40 seconds you are allowed to rest pause but i'm trying to discourage it i want to push you through this workout to make it the ultimate total body workout i want to push you to that next level try not to rest pause keep going i take that last 20 second rest and i come back and i go through my fourth round here and this time it culminates in the high pole from the floor so now i'm just going to pull these dumbbells and rip them off the floor and get them into that high pole position key here guys this is not an upright row you know how i feel about that exercise we're not doing it what we're doing is we're keeping the thumbs higher than the pinkies at the top i pull these all the way up to shoulder level i drop down to the floor and i keep this going for 40 seconds now at this point i've completed four round trips that is the entire circuit here it takes you just about five minutes now you get to rest two minutes and you go back and repeat this two more times for a total of a workout that lasts between 15 and 20 minutes it is intense but it's going to get the job done if you're looking for more workouts that can be done at home with just a single set of dumbbells you want to check out these 10 minute workout variations for shoulders and biceps and if you haven't already done so guys make sure you click subscribe turn on notifications so you never miss a new video when we put one out if you're looking for step-by-step programs guys all of ours are available over at atlantic.com see you soon [Music]"
