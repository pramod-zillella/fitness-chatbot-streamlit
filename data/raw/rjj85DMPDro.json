    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. It's a bodyweight Wednesday and today we're\ngoing after the arms. A lot of people think that you cannot get\nbig arms by using bodyweight, but that is a myth. I'm going to show you today with just four\nexercises and one pullup bar how to start building bigger triceps and biceps, starting\nright now. So there you have it, guys. Two exercises for each muscle group, kill\nswitch style, bodyweight only, and one pullup bar, no excuses. If you're looking for a complete training\nprogram that doesn't even use a damn bar, ATHLEAN0, over at ATHLEANX.com! No bars, no bands, no bench, no bull. You guys can get that over there. A six week training program. In the meantime, if you've found this video\nhelpful leave your comments and thumbs up below. Tell me what else you want to see on our bodyweight\nWednesday videos and I will do my best to cover them. All right, guys. We'll be back here again real soon!"
