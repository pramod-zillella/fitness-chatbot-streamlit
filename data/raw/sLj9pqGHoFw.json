    "transcript": "who knew the fastest way to build Jack forearms is to train a muscle that isn't even really a forearm muscle okay that doesn't make any sense what's the grass roof cavaliere athleanx.com okay look you've heard me say it a bunch of times if you want to build bigger arms you got to focus on your triceps right we talked about the overall mass and the contribution of the triceps to the arm even though people like to focus on the biceps well in the forearm we have the same scenario there's a muscle called the brachioradialis that kind of acts like the triceps of the forearm taking up a lot of the mass as a matter of fact if you didn't have good development there your form will kind of look like this and that's not a good looking for arm so we need to develop it but as I said it's not technically even a forearm muscle now trust me guys this has nothing to do with splitting hairs or playing word games here and semantics this is about real anatomy and function and we always when we talk about anatomy function have to break out these muscle markers and we talk about this muscle you could actually probably feel it if you grab hold of that wad of muscle right there it goes up and it crosses the elbow and it asserts up here on your humerus and then it comes all the way down and it kind of dies off right where it looks like it does in that mid belly and it tendon runs down here to the end of the bone and your arm called the radius here in your forearm and no point does that muscle actually cross the wrist which is a huge important point because we know that the forearm muscles actually run down your forearm and feed through your wrist into your fingers controlling actions of the fingers and the wrist itself that's what a true forearm muscle does this one has no action at all on the wrist so what it does is this gonna be influenced by things that you do at your elbow and also what happens here at your forearm pronation or supination but this is where the controversy comes in because getting to the actual true function of this muscle is going to help us to build it but people argue about what the function of the muscle is no one's gonna argue about the fact that it's going to be required that you bend your elbow to train it but what about that secondary part what about the position in the fore should it be supinated neutral or pronate to really get at the most and the answer is there's actually two answers and as always science is guiding what we're talking about look if I had a supinated arm here we know that immediately the bicep is going to take over because it's in a great line to do the work that we're trying to do here and bend the elbow if we go into this neutral grip position here like this that's where a lot of people argue that the brachioradialis is doing most of the work however they're forgetting one aspect of that that might be where it could generate the most force and lift the most weight but we also have to realize that it has the capability to pronate the forearm so if we want to train the muscle through all of its functions we want to get pronation and elbow flexion similar to when we do the biceps we don't want to just flex at the elbow here but we also want to flex with the shoulder that's where we get the greatest muscle activation and to get the greatest gains you're gonna want to do both overload with the greatest amount of weight and activate the muscle as much as you possibly can and if you like the nerdy [ __ ] like I do here's a cool little fact for you when your forearm is in this neutral position that brachial radialis is in that peak position to generate more force because it's actually helping to protect your own body you see when you put weight in your hands combined with the downward force of gravity it's actually capable of pulling that radius down onto the ulna which is not something that we want when the brachioradialis does its job it can pull backwards lifting that back up and creating the proper space in your wrist so no wrist injuries all right so what are some exercises you want to do to help build this muscle up well we got to start with the classic reverse barbell curl well here we have some choices right based on what I just told you you can either use a straight bar which is going to put you in that fully pronated position and require that you use less weight but the trade-off being more muscle activation or you can simply just grab an EZ curl bar and realize that because of the curling here of the bar we get our wrists into a more neutral position meaning closer to neutral and that's gonna help us to load this up more the brachioradialis is gonna have the ability to lift more weight and give you an opportunity to train it for overload the fact here guys is you have your choices my recommendation is to mix them up to get the benefits of both [Music] the next exercise up is actually one you can do here at a lat pulldown machine that takes advantage of another fact about this all-important non for our muscle and that is the more flexion you get at the elbow the more activation you get in the muscle in other words even if you look back at that reverse curl in the first 30 or 40 degrees that brachioradialis isn't doing as much work as it does and the latter half of the range of motion we could take advantage of that here with this reverse grip lat pulldown because we get the ability to do that reverse curl and instead of stopping here at the head we can go back behind the head to get more and more and more flexion of that elbow and keep in mind we're still doing this at that pronated position so we're gonna get the secondary benefits of that maximum activation so we really might have to use a little bit less weight by the same time that activation is on point now if you're absolutely obsessed with having to use more weight on the exercise remember you're going to have to get out of that pronated grip so you gonna have to change the bar that you're using trade that one in for two ropes but keep in mind you're gonna have to wrestle these away from the guy who's already doing face balls [Music] the next one's not only a great conditioning exercise but it's also a great for our builder and its battle ropes you see we know we get a lot of elbow flexion just to swing these things around but the way we grab them matters if I grab them underneath here I'm putting myself in that super named position combined with elbow flexion is likely to turn that into more of a bicep exercise when we do it though out of this neutral grip or pronate a grip now we're shifting the focus to where it has to be and that is right there on the brachioradialis remember if those ropes are heavy feel free to grab it with that more neutral grip but if those ropes are light you really want to kind of burn this out then go for that fully pronated grip and get going [Music] now obviously dumbbells can also be used to effectively build this muscle up as a matter of fact they give us an advantage that's unique from barbells and that's the ability to grab them not just dead center but with an offset grip as you can see here when I take this grip I'm actually now providing the opportunity to overload pronation right the dumbbells tilted downwards and gravity is pushing down there for me to overcome that and straighten the dumbbell out into pronation I'm gonna have to lift up from that direction not only am i able to do that but I'm able to continue the motion up all the way into that reverse curl so I get that duplicate benefit guys remember you're not just locked into one piece of equipment whenever you're trying to train any muscle you certainly aren't when it comes to this one [Music] I now just put a little bit of give-and-take with the gym owners out there look I get it my infatuation with face polls and recommendation for everyone to use two ropes when they do them has probably caused you guys out there to have to go buy more ropes but now it's my turn to give back you see because one of the best ways for everyone out there watching to build their brachioradialis is actually do this clean up after your damn selves in other words put your plates back or even better put the place on the bar yourself take them off yourself carrying around the gym yourself you see this position here is ideal for targeting the brachioradialis it's got that good neutral grip position and not just that you have a good indirect opportunity here to accrue a lot more volume during the workout week so that you get an opportunity to provide more stimulus for growth the fact that is either that's not just good for your muscles it's just plain old-fashioned good community service now if only Jesse could figure that out now that makes a bunch of sense actually there's a bunch of plates lying around think I should go clean those up remember guys all muscles matter and when it comes to building this one the way you do the exercises you're doing makes all the difference if you're looking for a step by step program that puts the science back in strength accuse me Jeffrey head
