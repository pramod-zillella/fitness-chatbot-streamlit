    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere. Athleanx.com. \nHere I am with Jesse's replacement, Raymond.   So much better. Today we're going to talk about \nshoulder pain and impingement. And the fact is,   guys, you might be doing something right now to \ntry to get rid of the pain that you get whenever   you raise your arm up overhead or that pinch that \nyou get. But if you're not doing it all the way,   doing everything you need to be doing, then you \nmight still be dealing with this and you're kind   of getting frustrated and wondering why. So I'm \ngoing to show you what you need to do to finally   get rid of this once and for all. But it always \nstarts here with a little bit of anatomy because   we want to see what we're talking about. When \nwe're talking about impingement, we're talking   about a muscle here most almost all the time \nthe supraspinatus, which is one of the rotate   cuff muscles, that sits in this space here, okay? \nIt comes underneath this space, which I'll show   you over here, gets pretty damn crowded and it \nattaches to the arm up at the top here. All right,   so when we get impingement, when we raise it \nup, this structure here can-- and I can say   can get pinched-- because it's not always \nthe cause, okay? It can get pinched in here,   which causes inflammation of the tendon, pain, \nand then a cascade of other things that become   problematic whenever you go to lift and push your \narms up overhead. You can see how crowded it is,   as I said. You have a ligament here, the \ncoracoacromial ligament, that creates some space.   You have a bursa that sits under there. And then \nthe tendon's supposed to run and fit underneath   there. It's not very roomy, okay? So when we \nhave impingement we have problems. But the second   thing-- and this is what leads to really this long \nterm cure-- is it's not always coming from the   actual pinching of the tendon from the top down. \nWhat can also happen is you get a compression of   the tendon from the bottom up. All right, so that \nmeans that if this tendon's here, and I were to   internally rotate, you start to get this bending \nof the ligament over the bone. More importantly,   you can see it when you bring your arm up across \nyour body, you see how it kind of gets bent around   the corner, okay? As it gets bent around that \ncorner, that becomes problematic because there's   a lot of tension there. To see that better, we \nlook at this. If I were to demonstrate this,   let's say this is the arm at the shoulder, and \nthis is the supraspinatus tendon. And I have a   load on this, so I push my foot in it. This would \nbe simulating a weight in your hand. The load   right here is being directed straight down. But as \nI go and I bring the arm across the chest, right,   or I go into internal rotation, or I do both \nof them, look what happens as I start to wind   this up. As I start to wind that up and across \nmy body, you could see all the compression now   that's underneath this band at this point. That's \nimpacting this tendon from the bottom up, causing   inflammation, causing breakdown, causing tears. \nThese are the problems. So if you're not just   addressing creating more room, you got to be able \nto address getting your body more accommodated to   this stress because this is going to happen. Your \narms are going to go across your body. They're   going to do it whenever you workout. They're going \nto do it in a way that, especially even chest work   is going to go, and become a component of that \ninduction that we talk about all the time. It's   a good thing. But you have to be used to that or \nit causes this inflammation down the road. So what   do we do? So we have a couple things. Number one: \nif you took a band here and you wanted to work on   improving your external rotation strength, which \nis critical, and I build it into all my programs   because I believe it's that important to do. All \nof us need to be doing work for our rotator cuff   strength. All right, so if I were to go and \ntake this band and anchor it, your progression   would be the following. You would want to make \nsure that you started with something very easy,   which is an isometric contraction. So I just hold \nthis. Right, just step out just a little bit,   and hold it. I'm firing up the rotator cuff, that \ntendon, the supraspinatus tendon is working to   try to stabilize this position, and I go for sets \nof ten seconds, five seconds, ten seconds. Right,   and I work on this about three or four times aw \neek, maybe three to five sets. As you're able   to handle that, which you probably will pretty \nquickly because that's not a really high stress,   then I would start to try to get into the \nconcentric of it. So now I take my hand across the   body and I do these external rotation exercises. \nYou've probably seen them before. You've certainly   seen them if you've been watching our channel. \nThis is concentrically now shortening that tendon,   that supraspinatus muscle, and we're working \non the rotator cuff strength. Now, realize,   as I improve my rotator cuff strength, I'm going \nto be able to have that shoulder sit in a more   externally rotated position. When your shoulder's \nmore externally rotated, just in standing all the   time, you have more freedom to move your arm up \noverhead. The reason for that is the following.   Because this bony structure that that tendon \nattaches to, when we're in internal rotation, and   I raise it up, it actually gets stopped. There's a \nbony block. And I've shown you guys how to do that   before, literally turn your arm in like this, \nand then raise it up over your head. It's only   going to get so far. Turn your arm into external \nrotation, it's going to get much further. Because   you're clearing this bony bump from instead of \nbanging it into the stop here, you turn it out,   now it can go all the way up, and the arm can \ncome way up over your body. So that is in and   of itself going to help to create more room, but \nthat's not why we're really doing this. Why we're   doing it is because we have to get accommodated \nto that overload, that tension and compression   that's happening that I talked about on that bar. \nSo, from there now we're like, All right, let's   start getting it into that internally rotated \nposition under load, under eccentric stress,   okay. So what we do is now we take it here we take \na little bit of a step. So now it wants to pull me   back here. Eccentrically I have to control that. \nAll right, and I come back, and now this is the   level that I'm working at. And I still do this in \nmy three to five sets three times a week. Then I   say, All right, let's get that heavier eccentric \nload. Let's go a little bit further than that.   Because ideally we want to introduce heavy, \neven dynamic loads eccentrically, to be able   to be able to accommodate those tendons to the \nstress. So now I take a bigger step and I let   it kind of go here slowly. And I take a bigger \nstep. Again, not allowing it to simply whip me   into internal rotation, I'm controlling it into \ninternal rotation. And the final step is you go   for those plyometric type loads, and these apply \nto a lot of different tendon issues. Down in the   Achilles tendon, other places in the elbow, \nwe want to make sure that what we do is we   get ourself to the point where we can accommodate \nmore dynamic ballistic loads. So I have it here,   and then I step out that way, and again, I slowly \nbring it back. In here and back. In here and back.   Set it in here and back. So that's where you \nget to. When you're able to get to that level   two things happen. Number one: you will experience \na lot less pain and discomfort in your shoulder.   Number two: you won't have to do that three times \na week. You only have to do that, let's say,   one time a week. And the other two days a week \nthat you're doing your rotator cuff work, you can   go back to more of the concentric work, or some \nof the isometric work to kind of prevent a little   bit of overloading of that, but that's where \nwe want to get to. Now, one final progression   here. If you wanted to go a little further for \nthe induction component with internal rotation,   there's an exercise called a sword raise. So \nyou have your band and you're starting in this   position basically, right? So what you could do is \nwe can get ourselves into this position and just   isometrically hold it out here. Right, just being \nable to control this out in front of my body,   not letting it take me al the way here, but just \na little bit of isometric force. Then I could take   it, it could do a concentric version of this. And \nnow I'm in here and I'm trying to get to the top   position. Down here, top position. If I wanted to, \nI could take the eccentric exercise and not hold   it here, but hold it a little bit further up here. \nOkay, as I got stronger. But now I'm working this   concentric exercise here. Down and in, we call \nit a sword raise. Thumb down, like I'm taking a   sword out of this pocket, and I externally rotate \nup to the top to here, okay? Now I want to get   eccentric. So I'm in here, now I take the step \nover here, and I slowly control the eccentric.   Okay, now I want to take it a little further than \nthat. Heightened eccentrics. So now I'm up here,   I take a larger step, and I have to control that \nall the way down to that opposite pocket. And then   I want to get to that ballistic portion of it, \nthat end range here, that end goal where I have   it up here and I jump out, and I control it down. \nIn, it's up here, down, and I control it down,   up, out, and control it down. And the same rules \napply. So the fact is, guys, maybe you're doing   some rotator cuff strengthening. You need to be. \nWe've covered it so many times, and like I said,   we build into our programs for a reason. It's \nthat important for shoulder health. And it   doesn't matter what your overall strength level \nis. It doesn't matter what you're doing in your   program right now. Your shoulders can benefit \nfrom more strength in your rotator cuff. It's   going to lead to stronger movements in everything \nelse you do. So you can't ignore this, it's not a   baby exercise, it's not a remedial exercise, it's \na corrective exercise that we all can benefit   from doing. But maybe you stop it just doing the \nconcentric. Try to add these other components in,   especially if you got pain, start at the bottom, \nwork your way. And I promise you, ultimately,   the pain that you've been dealing with here. \nWhether it's being stretched from the top down,   or from the bottom up, the repositioning of the \narm and the shoulder joint, and the relief of some   of that tension underneath and the accommodation \nto that compression tension is something that's   going to help you in the long run. If you guys \nare looking for our programs where I said,   we build these into all of the things we do \nbecause it matters, you can find them over at   Athleanx.com.
