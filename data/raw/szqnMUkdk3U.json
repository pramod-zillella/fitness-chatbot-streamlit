    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com today we're talking all about free weight vs. body weight exercises is there one way you should be doing your exercises is there a better way for you to do them well we're not going to just do that today we're not just going to compare exercise versus exercise and point out maybe where those advantages come but we're also going to try to instill in you something called exercise equivalence if you had access to one or the other but not both which exercise would you swap in in this place if you wanted to be able to do a way to pull down but you didn't have access to a machine what's your best option I'm gonna go over those for you guys one by one here dealing strictly today with the back exercises and we're gonna kick it all off here with the first up our vertical pulling movements so we're looking at our vertical pulling movements we're looking for exercises that allow us to travel up and down in this frontal plane and we have a couple of great options here we know if you go bodyweight you're looking at some version of a pull-up or if we flip on your hand a chin up if we're in the gym we have access to a lat pulldown machine we'd be looking at the same type of motion it's still going straight up and down in this frontal plane is one better than the other well first of all again exercise equivalents these exercises are going to accomplish very much the same thing in terms of how they load the back and the back muscles in particular but there's something that we're actually going to look at more closely if we look at the pull-up here versus the pulldown a lot of things actually do look similar the arm travel is the same if we keep our arms in front of our body as you should on the lat pulldown and you keep your hands and your elbows out in front of your body as you should on the pull-up and you're gonna be protecting your shoulders and perform the exercise for the benefits that we know it can deliver you can actually add extra weight to the pull-up as well so you're not even really being dwarfed by the stack of the weight that the machine is providing you versus what you're using with your own bodyweight if you had options to do that the fact is it gets a little deeper when we look down here at the hip flexors if I had to give the advantage here to the pull-up for a reason it's the tremendous core benefits that it gives you as well when my knees are not locked underneath a pad like this that are relying strictly on the upward push of my hip flexors into that pad which is offloading the load that the core should be doing then I'm going to get a hell of a lot more out of doing this pull-up because I have to control the sway and prevent that extra sway with the strength of my core but again from a back standpoint you're getting a similar effect here and this would be your exercise equivalents if you only had access to bodyweight versions here the pull-up would replace the pulldown now if we wanted to go underhand get the biceps a little bit more involved we would go with the chin up or the underhand lat pulldown and once again you can see the comparison here we're getting a lot of the same benefits for the lats because the elbows come out in front of the body they place the lats on more of a stretch especially in the up top position so whether you're at the top here with the pull down or whether you're at the really bottom of the rep but the top arm position here of the chin up you're getting that good stretch on the last the initiation of the movement though is going to come a little bit more from the biceps because they're in this perfect position to contribute the forearm is supinated the elbows out in front and when you pull you get that extra activation of the biceps so again on an exercise equivalency these two match up pretty good as you can see though once again guys these exercises all are working the back there's not a muscle that goes on worked here in your lats and your mid-back and your upper back making these great exercises regardless of which one you choose so next we move on to our horizontal pulling movements and here with a barbell there's nothing more classic than the barbell row this is a classic for a reason it's the best thing you could do in this plane to develop your back and your strength and progressively overload this exercise as a matter of fact it has additional benefits it's ground-based it allows you to train like an athlete like we always say and it also demands some additional stability of your low back to perform the exercise safely now if you don't have access to this though what are you going to do remember you got to look at the movement pattern to find the equivalent and the equivalent here is with a bar actually but it could be a broomstick if you don't even have access to a piece of equipment here and you put it across a couple chairs and you do the exercise I'm showing you this is the inverted row see it's all about relative motion instead of pulling the bar to my body like I do in a row I'm just pulling my body to the bar but the muscles that are doing the job are still doing the same work they're still pulling in the same plane and they're still trying to pull the weight whether it be in the form of your body or the barbell in this same direction so we're gonna work these muscles the same way and if you're looking for a ways to scale it or make it more difficult or you're worried that this isn't going to give you the same type of overload you have ways to overload this you can change the position of your feet get your feet out further away from your body straighten your knees out put your feet up on top of something to make it even harder all these things are gonna make this exercise more difficult by making you have to pull more weight as a matter of fact I can add some weight maybe got an old weight plate thrown around somewhere in your basement put that on your chest and now the exercise becomes even more difficult so regardless of whether you're training with free weights or your own body weight you've got an option and then finally we talked about something that doesn't get talked about all that much or not enough for me and that is how we train our straight arm scapular strength it matters actually it's critical to not just strengthening all elements of your back but to providing the benefits of strength on all the other back exercises you do including the ones we already covered here so we need to do this and if you're in the gym my favorite way to do this is with an exercise called the straight arm push down and you see here it needs a cable machine with a bar but it allows us to do exactly what we're trying to do here and that is we train with our arms straight elbows locked out looking for that adduction getting the elbows down and into our sides still getting that same stretch we're getting the benefit of on the underhand pull down but isolating this so that the lat does the initiation of every single contraction dominium that the stability of the shoulder blades is there in order to allow us to perform each rep correctly but what do you do if you don't have access to this are you screwed no you got an opportunity here guys to do something else remember you got to find the same motion and mimic it in a bodyweight environment and this is what you would do you do this inverted straighter and push down it's just a modification on the position we just had here you tuck your feet way underneath you because what you're going to do is you actually be sliding your body far back behind the bar see those arms are still going to do this they're still going to go from a position here to a position here but because they can't move because they're on the bar you're gonna have to move your body back you can see that happening here if you push hard and initiate with the lats once again in this position your body will go backwards and that's because of the job of the lats same muscles working different relative direction instead of moving the arms down you're moving your body away from those arms we can accomplish the same thing guys and if we have to and we're looking for an even greater challenge you can do something like this and this is a challenge even for me there's a front level race this is a more difficult version of straight arm scapular strength but it's doing the same thing you can zero in once again the position of the arms is also doing the same thing its closing down that angle from somewhere up here to somewhere closer to our sides all because of the strength of the lats pushing down into that bar and manipulating your body in space because of it so guys I hope you found not just these exercise equivalencies helpful because again when regardless of what training environment you find yourself in I want you to have an option to be able to swap out too that's going to be one of the main benefits of this series but beyond that even if you had access to both of them in all cases here are there some advantages from one versus the other that you should seek out especially if you know where your weaknesses are they might allow you to actually work on them a little better now that you know what those advantages are so if you found a bit of helpful guys make sure you leave your comments and thumbs up below if you want to see more of these let me know what kind you want me to cover I'll do that for you in the days and weeks ahead if you're looking for programs that make these smart exercise choices because they matter if you make the right choices and you know what it is you're trying to accomplish in a workout based on the goals that you say you have then I know how to get you there the fastest because I know which exercises are gonna get the job done we build those all into all of our programs over at athleanx.com meantime
