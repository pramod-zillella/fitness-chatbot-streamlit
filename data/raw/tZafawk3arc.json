    "transcript": "And so the irony of all ironies, the \nexercise with the word upright in its name,   it's the one most likely to \nleave you on your back. \n  What up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. What \nyou see behind me is a bunch of different shoulder   exercises. Many of them you probably recognize \nbecause you've either done them in the past or   you're still doing them today. However, after \ntoday's video, you're going to want to get rid   of a few of them. You see, I m going to rank them \nfrom the worst to the best to leave you with only   the best shoulder exercises that are going to \ndeliver you the gains that you're after. \n  And so as we begin the ranking process here, it's \nimportant to define the criteria upon which the   exercises are ranked. And while progressively \noverloading an exercise to develop strength is   an important element of all the exercises, it's \nnot the main criteria for how we select these.   We're looking for hypertrophy, we're looking for \nmuscle growth. And the ability of these exercises   to do that is going to be the main reason \nfor why we rank them in the order we do. \n  That being said, we always have to rely on the \nsafer options and when it comes to the shoulder,   the most mobile joint in the body, unfortunately, \nalong with that mobility comes some sacrifices to   our stability. With the lack of stability comes \nsome poor exercise choices, especially if going   to repeat them for years to come. We're not \ntalking about being able to get away with one   rep or even a few workouts. I'm talking about year \nafter year after year of doing these exercises,   that has to be part of the equation. We're going \nto want to mitigate those injury risk and leave   you with the better options that are still \ngoing to be able to produce the gains. \n  However, unlike anything else we've done in the \nseries before, we're talking about a different   setup here when it comes to the shoulder. We have \nthree distinct heads the front head, the middle   and the rear delt. We want to give you the best \nrankings for each of those heads. And of course,   I'm not going to overlook the fact that we want \njust overall shoulder development. I'm going to   give you give you some bonus rankings for those \ntoo. But that being said, let's just start off   where we always do with this series and that's at \nthe bottom and just work our way up because it can   only get better from there. And I'm going to start \nwith the worst of the worst, the Upright Row.\n  There's a saying out there that says \nthere's no such thing as a bad kid,   just bad parents. But luckily, when it comes to \nexercises, there's no family tree that we have   to worry about, and the Upright Row is just a \nbad exercise. Now I know a lot of people will   defend that and say there's no such thing as a bad \nexercise either, but I disagree. Every single rep   of an Upright Row places your shoulder into an \ninternally rotated position with elevation. Yes,   the exact position that you would test somebody \nin if you were looking for impingement. \n  When the biomechanics of the exercise itself \nare literally fighting your own body's anatomy,   I just can't wrap my arms around the exercise \nand love it. I don't care if you get away with   it in a single workout or even a training block \nor even 15 years of training with the exercise,   over time you're likely going to run into \na problem. And while yes, the exercise can   be improved slightly by lowering the height of \nthe barbell or dumbbells when you lift them up,   the fact is, there's better exercise options \nthat can achieve the same thing and do a better   job at it with lower risk. For that reason, \nthe Upright Row gets the first red X.\n  All right, so I mentioned that there's no family \ntree when it comes to exercises. But if there was   the Cuban Press would be the evil twin brother \nof the Upright Row. As a matter of fact,   maybe even more evil and that's because \nwe're adding another element to an already   bad biomechanical exercise. You see when we lift \nthis up, we're getting external rotation, which   some would argue makes this a good exercise. But \nit really isn't because you're lifting yourself   up there from an internally rotated position. Not \nto mention, the best part about this exercise is   probably the press because you've got your elbows, \nat least in a somewhat forward position. \n  However, the real dangers happen when you start \nto lower the dumbbells. You're getting into this   eccentric internal rotation again. But even \nworse, you've got to increase momentum with   those dumbbells further away from the chest, \nmaking this just more harmful to the shoulders   than even the Upright Row. For that reason, this \nalso gets the next big red X in this category. \n  Speaking about the press, can we talk about \nthe version we all started out doing the first   time we ever trained shoulders, the Behind the \nNeck Press. Look, I did it too and for no other   reason that I saw it in Arnold's Encyclopedia \nof Bodybuilding, and it looked pretty damn good.   Once again, doing this variation of the press \njust puts our shoulders in a position where   we're fighting our own anatomy. There's something \ncalled the scapular plain, which is a 45-degree   angle or so in front of our body so that the \nelbow doesn't have to track back behind our   body like it does in a Behind the Neck Press. \nThere is nothing wrong with an overhead press,   as you're going to see here later on this video. \nBut when we do it from this position, you're   placing yourself in an unnecessary injury risk \nthat we could do from a better position without   sacrificing any of the gains that we should be \ngetting from the exercise. So for that reason,   as always, the details matter, and in this \ncase, the positioning of the shoulder is too   far back makes this one one that I would also \nthrow in the bottom of the barrel category.\n  So if you haven't picked up on this by now as a \nphysical therapist, I don't like internal rotation   of the shoulder from an elevated arm position \nfor obvious reasons. That being said, there's   one exercise that can make me go from loving it \nto hating it just like that. It s this exercise   right here, it's the Side Lateral Raise, but done \nfrom the pour the pitcher position. You might have   heard this tip before that when you get to the \ntop of the lateral raise, you want to act like   you're pouring pitchers of water and have your \nthumb pointing down your pinky pointing up. \n  If you notice what's going on right there, yes, \nyou've got internal rotation from an elevated   arm position. That being said, when you realize \nyou can get the same activation and benefits to   the middle delt by simply leaning forward a \nlittle bit and keeping your thumb higher than   the pinky to ensure that you have external \nrotation at the shoulder, you're still going   to place that middle delt and that direct line \nof the downward force of gravity still making   it do all the work without sacrificing anything \nfrom the exercise, just increasing the safety of   it, and save the pitcher pouring for something \nyou do down here, maybe a table level and save   your shoulders in the process by putting the PTP \nside lateral raise in the big red X category.\n  And with that, I now get to break out my blue \nmarker as we work our way up the rankings, this   time to the Better Category. where we're talking \nabout good, solid exercises and specifically   hitting the front, middle and rear delt in that \norder. We start with the front and the exercise,   here is the Press Out. And while this is a \ngood exercise for targeting the front delt,   there are definitely some built in limitations \nhere, namely the lack of range of motion. We're   not taking the weight from our thighs all \nthe way up in an arc to end in this position,   we're kind of short cutting it by starting at \nour chest and simply ending in a position that   we expect to end in when we're targeting our \nfront doors. There are better options here that   won't be as limited, but I do believe this is a \ngood entry point exercise for those looking to   target the front delts, and that's why the Press \nDoes get the first in the Better Category. \n  Sticking in the Better Category, now working \nour way around to the middle delt, the exercise   of choice here is the Cheat Lateral. And I've \nmentioned the merits of this exercise before many   times on this channel. It gives us an opportunity \nto use a weight that we may not always be used to   using here if we're strictly limiting ourselves \nto light weights on a lateral raise. But at the   same time, that introduces some eccentric overload \nstresses that we know are good drivers of muscle   hypertrophy. However, with this comes often times \nsome extra momentum, and with the momentum comes   some muscle substitution. But if we're considering \nall aspects here and realizing that the momentum   in muscle substitution could be taking away from \nour ability to focus and drive our intention   through the middle delt, then we realize here that \nwe've done a good job of selecting the exercise,   but not the best yet. And that's why it \nbelongs in the Better Category for now. \n  Which brings us to the last of the Better Category \nand this time wrapping all the way around to the   rear delt. You do train your rear delts, don't \nyou? The exercise in focus here is the Reverse   Fly. This might be the most common exercise people \nperform when they're trying to target their rear   delts. Unfortunately, as I covered on this channel \nbefore, it's certainly not the best. And the main   limitation here is the range of motion. You see \nwhen you're trying to target the rear delt the   main thing you can try to do is get extension of \nthe arm back behind the body. It's not just about   abducting the arm away from you, as if you're \ndoing a side lateral raise bent over, it really is   about getting that arm back behind the body. And \nif you use even just a little bit more weight than   you can handle here, the range of motion is going \nto be limited even more. It's a good exercise. It   does work the rear delt, no doubt, but it's not \nthe best of its ability to do so. And for that   reason, we're going to put this one in the Better \nCategory when it comes to the rear delts. \n  And with that, we continue our way up the \nrankings to the Better Still Category,   and I break out my yellow marker to put our \nfocus once again back on the front delt.   And here we're looking at the Arnold Press. \nNow look, I realize that Arnold's become a   little bit of a polarizing figure these days, but \nthere's one thing I think we all could agree on,   the guy knew how to build muscle. And the \nfront delt exercise of choice that he used,   got your elbows out in front of your body because \nit demanded that you start with your hands facing   your body. And if you followed along to this \npoint, one of the reasons why I didn't like that   Behind the Neck Press was exactly due to the elbow \npositioning. This is getting that problem fixed   by getting your arms out in front of your body. \nHowever, as with all shoulder press variations,   it's tough to limit the gains to just the front \ndelt. When we realize that we have better options   for targeting the front delt more effectively, \nwe can see why this gets the Better Still   nod, but still not Best in this category.\nAnd continuing here in the Better Still Category,   we now shift our focus once again to the middle \ndelt. And here we're taking a step up from the   Cheat Lateral Raise with something called the \nAbduction Row. What it's doing is it's still   allowing us to use the heavier weights at the \nCheat Lateral might, but it's allowing us to do it   with a more focused contraction. Not necessarily \nsolely on the middle delt, which is impossible   anyway, but it does include more of a contraction \nat the top, which is something we didn't really   have control over with the Cheat Lateral. The way \nwe're accomplishing this is with a different set   of substitution muscles. As opposed to letting the \nupper traps kick in, we're actually able to turn   this into more of a rowing motion, hence the name \nwhich introduces some of the upper back muscles,   most notably the rear delt, which is going to help \nus to get this heavier dumbbell up to the top.   Because the movement is still driven with \nabduction of the elbow away from the side,   you're still going to get those immense \nbenefits in terms of creating a stimulus   for growth for the middle delt. Think of it like \n20% row, 80% abduction. And when you do, you're   going to have 100% of a good exercise option when \nit comes to creating better middle outgrowth. \n  I have to admit this one stings a little \nbit. Can we just get it out of the way? Look,   it's not often that we conclude any list of the \nbest exercises without Face Pulls ranking all   the way at the top. But when it comes to rear \ndelt exercises, it s a really solid option, but   it s just not the best. I know a dagger. However, \nlet's take a look at why. The Face Pull is,   as I've said many times in this channel, \none of the best exercises you could do   and one you should probably do at the end of every \nsingle workout you do because we simply do not get   enough attention to the posterior chain and \nthe muscles of the upper back and mid scap   that this exercise does a great job doing. \nBut therein lies the problem, the upper back   and mid scap. Throw in the rotator cuff and \nyou've got a lot of other muscles doing the job,   not just the rear delt, which limits this \nto being the best rear delt driver. However,   the Face Pull is always going to appear in a \nlist of great exercises, but for the rear delt,   it's a Better Still just not the best. \nAll right, that wasn't so bad. \n  And so with that, we now continue to work our \nway up the rankings. This time I get to break   out my green marker for the Almost Best Category. \nSo not quite at the top yet, but really damn good.   And for this, for the front delt, we're going back \nto the press and this time it's the Scoop Press.   You see, the Scoop Press has some very \nunique advantages over the Arnold Press,   namely an increased range of motion \nand focus on the front delt.\n  So you can see that when we start the \nexercise, we lock in by getting a fixed   90-degree position at the elbow. You're \nnot going to open that angle at any point   thereafter because we're not going to turn this \ninto a bicep exercise. Keep it locked in here,   and you're going to scoop your arms up to \nthat front rack or shoulder pressing level   and continue to press up overhead. We still have \nall the benefits of the elbows out in front of   our body that we do on the Arnold Press. But \nwe're getting the additional range of motion   on the first half of the exercise that still \nactually allowing us to utilize a heavy load   because of the bent arm position and the closeness \nof the dumbbells to our body. This exercise is   a better pressing option when you re looking \nfor better exercises, and it s the reason why   it belongs in the Almost Best Category. \nAnd that brings us to the next exercise here,   this one focused on the middle delt. And for \nthis we re going back to the Side Lateral Raise   in the Almost Best Category. I know what you're \nsaying, Jeff, you always do this. You say one   thing's bad and the next day you say it's good. \nNo, actually, guys as always, the details matter.   Did you realize that one word could actually \nchange the entire meaning of a sentence?   Like I could say, you make me really hard, or \nI can say, you make me really laugh hard.\n  See, it's a big difference when it comes to the \nSide Lateral Raise here, as I mentioned before,   the details matter a lot because this becomes a \ngreat exercise in the spot. When we're looking for   targeted middle delt growth, we want to lighten \nup the weight here and focus on the middle delt.   And we can do it in a much safer position \nby forgetting about pouring those pitchers.   Instead get that thumb higher than the pinky at \nthe top. Lean forward just a bit to make sure,   as I mentioned before, to keep that downward force \nof gravity squarely focused on the middle delt,   making it do all the work. Go through \nthe exercise at a slow but steady pace,   and this one becomes one of your best options \nwhen you're looking to create hypertrophy,   and it's one that needs to be in almost every \nshoulder workout when that's what you're after.   This is where the Side Lateral Raise gets this \nposition here and the Almost Best Category.\n  And wrapping up the Almost Best Category now \nwe turn our attention to the back side again,   the rear delt. And for this, I'm looking at the \nHip Hugger and this one gets its name from the   position of the dumbbells as you do the exercise. \nYou should look like you're trying to pick up a   pair of pants that kind of drop down to low. Now, \nif you look at the mechanics of the exercise,   the one thing that's in place here that's really \nimportant is the good extension of the arm back   behind the body. Remember, you don't have to \nlift your arms out to the side and keep them long   to get them into a position behind your body. You \ncan use heavy weights here. As a matter of fact,   you're going to need to use heavier weights \nhere to make this a main driver of growth. \n  However, we can limit some of the contribution \nof those upper back muscles that the Face Pull   wants to contribute by focusing more on pulling \nback with the elbows rather than straight up,   which would turn this into a shrug. If \nyou get the mechanics of this right guys,   I promise you one of the most intense rear delt \ncontractions you have ever felt. And it's one that   definitely belongs to the Almost Best Category \nand one that you definitely need to start doing   if you want to see the best results.\nAnd so we've reached the top of the top,   the best of the best, but we've got not one \nbut three winners here, one for each head of   the delts. And we start right here at the front \ndelts with the Dumbbell Front Raise. And when we   perform this exercise with dumbbells rather than \na straight bar, we have the opportunity to split   the hands up and do them in alternating fashion \none arm at a time. This affords us the benefit   to get a really strong focus on the muscle \nwe're trying to build and focus on getting   a good contraction at the same time, letting the \nfront delts do what they do best, flexing the arm   out in front of our body. There's no need to take \nthe arms all the way up overhead because that just   starts to introduce additional work being done \nby the upper and lower traps at now we're really   focused on here when frontal growth is your goal. \nGuys, this is the best of the best when it comes   to the front delt and it gets the first green \nstar or whatever the hell that shape is. \n  And so that brings us to the middle delt and \nagain, the best of the best in this category.   You're not escaping some variation of a side that \nare raised, except my favorite is when we do it   with a Cable Lateral Raise. And here you can see \nthat actually making a small adjustment here that   makes this even more effective. The cable set up \nallows me to get the main missing element from   the Side Lateral Raise, which is a stretch on the \nmiddle delt in the starting position. Think about   it unless you're performing the Dumbbell Lateral \nRaise on an incline bench with your arm dropped   in front of your body, you're never getting your \narm into a stretch position on the middle delt   and therefore not getting the best contraction \nyou can get. When we do the Cable Lateral Raise,   we're starting every single rep from a maximal \nstress position, which is going to allow you   to do this even better. Making it a better \noverall exercise when it's the middle delts   that you want to grow. And therefore it too \ngets that big green star or odd shaped whatever   for putting it in the best of the best. \nAnd so if the Reverse Fly did a good job of   getting that horizontal abduction and the hip \nhugger did a good job of getting that extension   that we're looking for. Well what if we marry the \ntwo? Again, back to the family aspect of this,   well, we would get the Rear Delt Row. What this \ndoes is it takes a lighter weight for sure,   but it gives us a chance to focus on getting the \nabduction of the shoulder away from the body,   but also more extension. And what we do is \nwe actually supinate the hand a little bit,   which allows us to create some external rotation \nat the shoulder, which will allow us to get our   arm into extension behind the body a lot easier \ncreating an overall better exercise. Just like   raising your arm up overhead it s easier with \nthe hand turned out rather than turn in. We get   the same benefit here and the end result is we \nhave a better contraction and an overall great   exercise option for hitting our rear delt. It's \ngetting the Best designation here when it comes   to the rear delt shoulder exercises. \nBut what if you're just looking to build   bigger shoulders overall? You're on a minimalist \napproach. You want to know what exercise is going   to do the best overall job of giving you the best \nbang for your buck. Well, at that point, guys, you   don't want to look to some of the presses in this \ncategory they're all really, really damn good.   You see, we have things like the Barbell Overhead \nPress, the Z Press, the Modified Bradford Press,   the Dumbbell Overhead Press and the Handstand \nPushup. And they're all good options. \n  Each one, of course, has its own benefits. Like, \nfor instance, the Barbell Overhead Press, while   being a great opportunity to really, really load \nheavily, does have a restriction for those people   that have some shoulder issues. Because of the \nfixed hand place on the bar that gets freed up,   we switch to the dumbbell version of the Overhead \nPress. The Modified Bradford Press gives those   guys that are still in love with doing the Behind \nthe Neck Press a secondary option if you notice   the elbow positioning remains in front of the \nbody, which is why we call it a Modified Bradford.   Never going back behind the body, so keeping \nyour shoulders safe, but limiting the range   of motion for those that have a difficult \ntime pressing all the way up overhead. The   Z Press is just an option for building up the \noverall strength of your entire shoulder when   you eliminate your legs from the equation in the \nseated position. You build your strength up here,   you take it back to a standing variation of a \npress and I promise you bigger strength gains   and bigger overall shoulders if you do so.\nAnd finally, the Handstand Pushup. If you just   don't have any access to weights at all, but you \ndon't want to compromise your shoulder growth, the   Handstand Pushup is a great exercise for targeting \nall three heads of the delts, and you can do it   with simply a wall and your own body. \nAll of these exercises are great options   when it comes to shoulder developers, and though \nnone of them are great specialists necessarily,   they're all incredibly powerful when it comes to \npacking on mass to your shoulders and therefore   ones that you don't want to overlook. \nAnd then you have the guys with the rankings   of these shoulder exercises now complete, \nyou have a better idea of what exercises   you should be focusing on and maybe which ones \nyou can kind of do without. The fact is, guys,   when it comes to exercise selection, the details \nmatter as always.
