    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere. Athleanx.com. \nIt's right, your grip is now killing your gains.   You see, we're taking back the killing your \ngains videos to actually make a good killing   your gains video. Look, do something for me, \nhold your hands out. I'm going to prove this   to you right here. Right, take your hand, now \nturn one of them to face yourself. Which finger   is the longest? For most of you, it should be \nthe middle finger. Jesse, the length of your   middle finger has nothing to do with-- No, no, \nno, Jeff. You make an L and it's the distance   between your thumb and your forefinger. Oh my \nGod, that's frightening. Okay, look, forget that,   hold your hand out. How long is the middle finger, \nright? Now when you close your hand down, look at   which finger is now the longest. For most of us \nit should be that ring finger now extending longer   down. Now that happens because anatomically the \nway our fingers fan out we're going to make that   longer, but there's an implication for this. Now \nsqueeze your hands as hard as you possibly can,   squeeze those fingers into that base of your \nhand. Which one is exerting the most force?   You can probably see on mine it's that same ring \nfinger. The reason for that is that you've given   yourself more leverage. This is the longest finger \nbeing able to create the most leverage and force   through your hand. Well, guess what happens \nwhen you go grip a bar or a pull-up bar. This   finger tries to dominate, and when it does, it \ncreates problems all the way down here. You see,   this inflammation right here is the most common \nfor anybody that's ever lifted a weight. If you've   ever done any type of heavy pulling movement, \nyou've likely at some point in your life dealt   with some type of pain on the medial elbow here. \nIt's called medial epicondylitis or golfer's   elbow. It's a pretty harsh pain. It feels like \nsomeone's driving a knife right into your elbow.   The reason for that is because-- and break out the \nmarkers to show you why-- because there's a muscle   that connects these two points. And I talked about \nthis in the past, but it bears repeating here,   because it's going to make you really understand \nthis. It's called the flexor-- write this down,   Jesse-- flexor digitorum superficialis, \nor FDS to make it a little bit easier for   you, Jesse. Yes, it's very difficult for me. So \nnow what it does is actually got two heads. One   head comes right off of that point and it comes \ndown here to the wrist and then it feeds off   into two fingers, the fourth finger and the fifth \nfinger, and it inserts right here onto that middle   interphalangeal joint here, okay, and our fingers. \nAnd the other one comes over here and it goes into   the pinky. So then we've got this other head that \nkind of comes off and shares a common tendon here,   but what it does is it mostly comes off of the \nradius, and it feeds down, and then it comes   down here into the wrist, and then this goes \nand it feeds off into the second finger, right,   the pointer finger and into the middle finger. \nWell, because we know how much of a contribution   this finger want to make in terms of any time we \nmake a grip on a bar or a pull-up bar, this is the   one that not ironically is the one that's got the \nmost tension and stress being placed right there   at that insertion right here, on the medial elbow. \nSo what we want to do is we want to figure out a   way now when we go to grip something, that we can \nminimize the contribution of this, to minimize the   dominance that this wants to do. Because you \nguys can see it's a pretty thin muscle. This   can't handle all kinds of heavy loads-- weighted \nchin-ups, heavy rows, dead lifts-- it can't handle   that on its own. You need to figure out ways to \nmake that work. So, with that being said guys,   let me take you over to our mock pull-up \nbar to show you how to get this right every   time. All right, guys, so here's our make shift \npull-up bar. What we're looking for is two things,   right? When we're going to direct our hands into \na bar, and then lift our own body weight with or   without additional weight, you want to make sure \nthat you're not putting that bar too far out   into those fingers for the reasons I just said \nwhere we're overloading all of them. Okay, you   want to make sure that the bar is in a position \nwithin the hand that's going to allow you to take   advantage of the additional strength you get from \nthe structure of the hand. The next thing you want   to do is you want to minimize the contribution of \nthat fourth finger like we talked about. So how   do you do the first thing first? Well, guys, if \nyou have an inflammatory condition. Right, here,   here's a quick test if you have it, right? What \nyou do is you take your hands and you just cover   three fingers. We're going to test this finger. \nYou cover these three fingers, you push down right   on that middle joint, just like that and you're \ntrying to keep it from getting pushed down. So I'm   trying to pull it up this direction. You shouldn't \nfeel anything at that spot. Now you cover these   three fingers, right, you keep them back and \nyou try to test this one out. You shouldn't feel   anything, it's the middle finger. Now you cover \nthose three fingers and you try to test this one   here. And this is where it's going to light \nup like a Christmas tree. This is where that   knife is going to be stuck right into that medial \nelbow if you're having this pain. And of course,   you could test the last one by holding that one \nback, and then pulling up on this. You probably   shouldn't feel much there either. It's just \nreinforcing how bad it is. If it's really bad,   then a few exercise substitutions you should make \nis to take anything that you're doing underhand,   and just flip it overhand for now to allow \nyourself to get out of that acute phase. So   if you have been doing underhand lat pull-downs, \nyou do over overhand lat pull-downs. If you have   been doing chin-ups or weighted chin-ups, you \ngo to overhand pull-ups. You try to widen your   grip a little bit too which will help. And \nif you have been doing mixed grip deadlifts,   you try to go back to a double overhand. I'll \nget to that in a second. If you're doing rows,   any kind of underhand rowing should be substituted \nwith overhand rowing for the time being. But back   to the pull-up bar, what you do is a couple \nthings, you want to target this joint right   here. Okay, this is the joint that you want to be \naware of because this is going to dictate-- Jesse,   you can come around the back, I'll show you what \nwe're talking about-- where this bar is being   placed in your hand because you want to make sure \nthat bar is being placed deep into your hand. So   if I go and I grab the bar for a pull-up, and I'm \ngoing to get down here as if I'm under the bar.   What I want to see is I don't want to see that \nknuckle if I'm doing the pull-up. All I want to   do is be able to see these. And if you get from my \nperspective here, all you should be able to do is   see these, right? So at that point, if I start to \nfail, and I start to lose my grip, and I start to   come down like this, all of a sudden guess what \npops up into view? Those other knuckles that we   talked about. You don't want that. Because as \nsoon as that does, look at all of that stress   it's placing right at the end of those tendons. \nThey're hanging on for dear life, and again,   this is going to do most of that pulling for the \nreasons we already talked about with the most   leverage that's going to come right down here \nand overload that medial elbow. Okay, not good,   especially if you have additional weight that \nyou're doing this exercise with. So you only   want to see these knuckles. Now, if I switch to a \nchin-up, it's the same knuckle in question here,   but in this case I want to see it. I want to see \nthe tops of them. Because the only way I could see   them is if I get the bar deep enough into my hand \nto be able to see them. If I can't see them and   they go out of view, and all I could see are these \non the chin-up, now again I'm overloading, you can   see that overloading these distal tendons that are \ngoing to place all of that stress down here at the   elbow. So how do we do the next thing here? The \nnext thing would be to decrease the influence of   this fourth finger from doing so much work. Well, \nI've shown this to you guys in the past, it works   like magic, okay? You take a band, if you have \none, you wrap it around and you tie it around the   bar, right? This sets up two little pieces of the \nband like this. When you go to do your pull-ups,   you put your fourth and finger on top of the band \nlike that, you take the other three fingers, you   put them on the bar. What this has done is this \nhas shifted the focus to these three fingers to do   the majority of the work to grip that bar and pull \nyou up. Because we've increased the distance here   and changed the [inaudible 07:21] relationship \nof these muscles, we've actually decreased their   contribution a little bit. We kind of deadened \nthem a little bit in terms of how much they want   to dominate that. And if you try it yourself, \nyou'll feel this right way. If you have elbow   pain, and you make this switch, and you're now \npulling through here, you'll feel most of the work   is now being done here and that elbow pain that \nyou were experiencing five seconds ago you won't   feel it anymore. Right, so you do them with two \nbands hanging off of the bar. Okay, you could do   the same thing when we do the chin, and you could \ngrip them this way, again, and pull from there,   and that will even decrease the pain that you feel \non a chin-up. But again, if you're really acute,   I would shift the weight from the chin-up at \nthe time being. So with that being said, guys,   now I want to address finally the barbell, and \nshow you a couple of things you want to do there.   All right, so now with the barbell work, this \nis the source of a lot of your gains and your   training. But again, if this is flared up, your \ngrip is directly killing your gains because you   can't do as heavy a barbell work as you'd like \nto do because this is causing a big block to what   it is you're trying to accomplish. So again, we \nhave a two-part strategy. Whenever you grip this   barbell, your goal should be to try to grip it as \ndeeply into your palm as you possibly can. Now you   might be thinking that, Hey look, Jeff, you told \nme in the past like bend my wrist back when I do a   curl. It doesn't change the fact that you want to \nhave the barbell deep. Because if we take it like   this, right, and we take the barbell-- I'll use \nmy finger as the barbell-- and I place it deep in   the palm, and I grip around it. Even if I were \nto bend my wrist back, and the purpose of that   by the way is to sort of deaden the forearm \nfrom contributing too much and dominating a   bicep curl. Well, you can still see that if their \nbarbell is sitting deep enough in the palm here,   that it's still resting directly over my forearm, \nwhich provides the support at that top. It's not   being carried all the way out here, which is not \nonly going to overload those tendons, but it's   also going to place an inordinate amount of strain \nand stress on that muscle too, which could cause   some traction stress on that same point. Further \nproblems, right? So you want to get that barbell   deep in your hand. But there's another thing \nyou can do here. I had mentioned I would get   to it. You could switch momentarily to a hook \ngrip. Now what the hook grip does, ironically,   is it actually takes the exact problem that you're \nhaving in loading these two fingers too much,   and it literally shifts all the load to these \nthree fingers. So if you come around I'll show   you what we're talking about. The hook grip is not \nreally a comfortable thing. It's something that   takes getting used to. But again, biomechanically \nit's the exact solution to the problem you're   having right now. And even if you get used to it, \nyou might wind up sticking with it because it will   take away some of the risks that might come from \nhaving a mixed grip on a deadlift as the weight   gets heavier. So if we take our hand here, what \nyou want to do is you want to go over the top,   but you want to dig it as far into this crevice \nas you possibly can. So you come all the way down.   Right, we're not just getting deep into the palm \nlike we were talking about before, but now we're   getting really deep into here so that I can get \nthat thumb across. Right, and the goal here is   that if I get that deep enough, these two fingers \nnow are going to position themselves one over the   nail and one behind the knuckle, like that. Okay, \nand then we dig in. Now what's happened here just   by getting into this position is these two fingers \nhave dramatically been decreased in terms of their   contribution to this grip. Everything is now being \nsqueezed through here. And if you feel pain when   you do this it's likely because you're pressing on \ntop of the knuckle. You don't want to be pressing   directly down on top of the knuckle. You could \ndo that right now and you'll likely feel that it   kills. You want to be around that knuckle. Okay, \none in front, one behind, you could squeeze this   as hard as you possibly can, it's not going to \ncause any discomfort right now. So when we get   in that position, again, now when I go and \nI grip, and I pull, whether I'm doing a row,   whether I'm doing a deadlift, whatever I'm doing, \nit's shifting the focus away from that ring finger   here that wants to dominate this movement and \nis giving you a reprieve-- maybe temporarily,   maybe forever-- from the overloaded stress that's \ncausing all this elbow pain. And when you get rid   of the elbow pain, guys, then you're getting rid \nof that long term problem that is going to inhibit   your ability to make gains in the gym. Your \nheavier lifts are going to depend upon you having   the right grip. If you get this sorted out here, \nguys-- hopefully now with a few modifications--   these are the problematic exercises, now \nyou have a way to get around them.
