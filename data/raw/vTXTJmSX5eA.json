    "transcript": "Don't ever set a limit on your potential to\nachieve. Maybe you wish one day to bench 1.5 times\nyour bodyweight. That's the goal you've set. Fine. But what happens if one day you actually reach\nyour goal? I can tell you one of two things will happen. The first: you set your sights on a new one,\nif you're lucky, and you work toward improving on that. But the second, which is much more common,\nis you get complacent. You feel like maybe your work is done and\nyour progress stalls out. I can tell you this: 50% of those scenarios\nsuck. So here's an alternative. Instead, identify your weakness and work every,\nsingle day to do just one thing – at least one thing – that positively aligns your\nefforts with turning that weakness into a strength. Don't obsess with numbers. Obsess with your effort. Before you know it you might even be much\nfarther ahead than what you even dreamed was possible in the first place. In this scenario, 100% of the possible outcomes\ndon't suck. Got it? Good. Now go get it done."
