    "transcript": "Wait a minute, you said 14 sets to look like \nthis guy in 14 sets to look like this guy?   You click baiting son of a bitch. No, actually, \nit's the truth and there's seven big reasons why.   What's up, guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. So, \nyou want to build a bigger, stronger chest and you   want to know exactly how many sets to do each \nweek to get the job done best. Well, guess what?   You're in the right place and you're asking the \nwrong question. You see, you probably shouldn't   be asking that question specifically without \nasking yourself some other questions first.   And I'm happy to do that for you, because in this \nvideo, I'm going to ask those questions of you and   get you the number that you're looking for. \nAnd guess what? We're not going to just stop   at chest. With the information \nthat we get from these answers,   you're going to be able to build every muscle \nin your body just like that. So that being said,   let's start breaking down these questions and \ngetting the answers I need from you right now. \n  And so, as always, in cases like these, \nit's oftentimes best to rely on science   and let the science tell us what we \nshould do. But in a question like this,   you're going to be disappointed. Because \nthe recommendation for the number of sets   per muscle group per week to optimize the growth \nand strength of that muscle is somewhere between   eight and 32 sets. That's not really that \nhelpful. But the reason for this variability   between set recommendations has largely to do \nwith the fact that we need to start asking these   other questions. So, let's get right to it.\nMy first question to you is, are you natural   or are you enhanced? See you guys, you have to cut \nto the chase if you're using drugs, be it steroids   or TRT, and yes, TRT is included, because most \nof the time these guys are not taking replacement   dosages, but super physiological dosages and we \nknow that. So, you have to understand that you are   getting a big advantage when it comes to building \nmuscle. You're able to recover at a much faster   rate. When it comes to natural lifting, recovery \nis everything. If you can't recover from the work   you're doing, you're not going to grow. If you \ncan't recover from the strength work you're doing,   you're not going to get stronger. You have \nto be able to recover from what you're doing   if you want to see gains. People that are \nusing PEDs are going to be able to do this   a lot easier and faster than you can. They can \ntolerate higher workloads, greater intensities,   greater volumes and overall greater gains. \nGuys, listen, ultimately, the choice is yours.   However, I'll tell you that even though it takes \nmore time to achieve the results you're looking   for, naturally. Personally speaking, I can tell \nyou that is much more rewarding and gratifying   when you do it that way. That being said, we do \nhave to make sure we get the other things right.   And it starts with asking you the next question, \nand that is, what is your experience level? \n  So, we all know that beginners can pretty much \nbreathe on away and oftentimes see increases in   strength and size. Most of all, because their body \nsimply hasn't been subjected to that stimulus over   and over again, and it hasn't had the chance to \nsort of become numb to it. That's a good thing.   That means your volumes are going to be lower if \nyou're just starting out. On the other side of   the equation, the advanced lifter has built up a \ntolerance and has been able to increase the number   of sets and reps that they perform over the \ncourse of a week, increasing their weekly volumes.   That being said, as you get stronger and as \nyou start to employ more intensity techniques,   even the advanced lifter has to become a little \nbit more considerate of the amount of intensity   that they're bringing to their training, which \nmight drop their set totals down for the week.   The bottom line is that your weekly set totals \nis going to be influenced by your experience   level. And for those beginners out there, it's \nbest to start at that lower end of the range and   simply add sets as your body accommodates to the \nincreased workload. And for those advanced lifters   out there, you're going to be able to experiment \nwith higher and higher weekly set totals. Just be   mindful of the fact that other things matter. \nMost importantly, what are you training for,   hypertrophy or strength? Because when it comes \nto strength, your answer is actually going to   be pretty simple because it's guided by your \nown goal. If you're training for strength,   you know that you need to perform your sets within \nthe three to six rep range, within a certain   intensity level between, let's say, 80% and 85%. \nAnd when you can't perform your sets any more   in a given training session within that range, \nthat you really don't have to do any more sets.   And that's going to dictate how many sets you \ndo in a given session that's going to protract   itself out over the course of the week. \nNow, granted, you might want to do an extra   set or two to continue to work on perfecting \nyour former technique. That's fine. But you   certainly want to continue to do more and \nmore and more and drop the weight more and   more and more because you're not really aligned \nwith your goal anymore. And doing any more of   that is just simply accruing junk volume. So, \nwhat you need to do is define what it is that   you're actually training for. If you're training \nfor hypertrophy, well, guess what? The answer   becomes a lot more open-ended and variable. \nAnd for that, I have to ask you yet another   question, and that is, how hard are you training? \nAnd see, when it comes to making muscle gains,   the amount of volume you use is going to be \ninversely related to the amount of effort that   you put forth in your workouts. The more effort \nyou put forth, the lower your volume can be.   You can start to veer towards the lower part of \nthat range, 13, 14 sets. If you're going to start   bringing that sub maximal volume, stopping \nevery one of your says, well, short of failure,   you're going to have to start upping the \nnumber of sets that you do per week. \n  And again, I like to sort of go on the other side \nof it by training intensely. I try to take all of   my sets to failure. When I define failure, I'm \ntalking about form failure. You would still be   able to recognize the exercise I'm doing. \nI just simply couldn't complete another rep   in good form without bastardizing the movement. \nIf I take each one of those sets to failure,   then I don't have to do as many sets as somebody \nwho likes to stop every set short. Again, science   will show that maybe we don't have to take all \nof our sets to failure. However, I have a limited   amount of time within which to train, I like to \ngo hard and get out quickly. If you want to do   the same and you can experience games that way. \nIf you want to go completely on the light side   of this, guys, there s even hope for you too. \nI share this story before about my wife, who has a   set of traps on her that even Brock Lesnar would \nenvy. And the reason for it? She's a barber and   she spends her days like this cutting hair. She's \nonly holding a five-ounce pair of scissors. Oh,   by the way, for six days a week, 10 hours a day. \nYou see, if you're willing to go incredibly high   on the amount of volume that you put forth, you \ncan go incredibly low on the amount of weight   that you lift and ultimately the effort you put \nforth in your workout. Just be aware that the   more you're willing to leave it all out there on \nthe floor, the less time you're going to have to   spend doing it, because a set cow can come down \nper workout and ultimately over the course of a   week. And the less you're willing to sort of push \nyourself on a given set, the more time you're   going to have to spend getting those results. \nThe fact is the decision is yours and which one   you choose is ultimately up to you. But be aware, \nthere are some other factors that might want to   steer you in one direction versus the other. \nWhich brings me to my next question, which is   actually a two part one, and that's how old are \nyou? And do you have any drug related issues?   Because you don't even have to be old to have \ndrug related issues, especially if you have a   history of playing sports. The fact is, though, \nthe answer to that question is going to determine   how many sets you ultimately have to do or may \nwant to do. You see when you're younger and free   of joint related issues, you can actually get \naway with a lot more volume. As you get older   or start to incur some of those injuries, the \nsituation becomes a lot less forgiving. \n  You see, when I was younger, I didn't even have to \ndo many warmups sets to get myself ready to do a   bench press. But now I have to actually prepare \nmyself to do that. But here's the good thing,   your body is actually far less susceptible to \nthe stress of the load as it is to the number   of times that you're lifting the load. So, if \nI were to put, let's say, 185 pounds in the   bar and lift it versus 225 pounds in the bar and \nlift it, that's not necessarily the straw that's   going to break the camel's back when it comes \nto the issue, you're having your shoulder or   the inflammation you're having your shoulder. \nIt s the number of times that you perform that   doing 80 repetitions over the course of many \nmore sets versus 20 or 30 repetitions over far   fewer sets it's going to be ultimately the thing \nthat saves your shoulder from the inflammation   and the thing that keeps you in the gym. \nBecause ultimately, if that injury becomes   so inflamed that you can no longer \ndo your work as then you're accruing   zero volume and making zero gains. So, this is a \ncase where actually doing less equals more in the   long run and it's actually related to my next \nquestion, which is a very important one. \n  And that is, are you actually recovered from \nyour training? Because whether or not you're   training for a bigger chest or a stronger \nchest or really any muscle, for that matter,   you're only as good as your body's ability to \nrecover from the last workout and be prepared   for the next workout. And when I m talking about \nnext, I'm not just talking about the next workout,   I'm talking about every next workout. Because your \ngoal should always be improvement in some way,   shape or form. If you're training for strength, \nare you able to continue to add weight to the bar   or has the last session left you in a place where \nyou actually can't do that anymore? Because if it   has, you need to revisit the volume that you're \nperforming right now and make decreases to that.   From a hypertrophy standpoint, if the next workout \nis actually impaired by the soreness that you   created in this workout, then you need to not only \nconsider the volumes that you're doing right now,   but also the techniques you're using, which \nactually brings me to my last question. \n  And that is, what exercises are you actually \nperforming and how are you performing them?   Because all that matters as well. You see, \nif your chest workout consists of bench   press and let's say heavy weight, it dips versus \ncrossovers and bench flies don't do bench flies,   by the way the requirements for getting the job \ndone are going to vary dramatically. And that's   because those single joint exercises are going to \noftentimes be performed with much lighter weights,   which you're going to require additional volume to \nget that stress required to produce muscle growth.   At the same point, those compound exercises that \nare much more taxing and demanding on the body   that lend themselves to more progressive overload \nand strength are going to ultimately bring that   set count down because you're able to induce more \nresults at a quicker, faster pace. Not to mention,   as I said, the way you perform these sets would \nmatter as well for the reasons we just talked   about before. If you're using eccentric muscle \noverload, because let's say you've tapped out   all of your available strength gains at the moment \non an exercise, we know we can induce more muscle   growth, but at what cost? We'd have to make \nsure that we're allowing for more recovery from   those additional stresses, from eccentric muscle \ndamage to make sure we keep those gains coming.\n  And all of this now comes around to \nformulate one final question that   you probably should be asking me right now. \nAnd I know you're probably thinking, Jeff,   if I know how many steps I'm supposed to do in \na week, how can I ultimately split that up n the   case of the chest to make sure I get the job done \nthe right way? I m happy to answer it for you.\n  So now considering everything we've learned in \nthe fact that the general consensus within this   broad range of eight to 32 says with the available \nscience we have is that somewhere between 15 and   18 sets is sort of the safe place to start. We \nwant to make those changes either up or down based   on the answer to your questions. And when we take \nan example like the chest, we're going to say,   how do they now fit into an overall training week \nbased on some different types of splits you might   be following? So, if we took basically a push pull \nleg split we would have, let's say, our push day   falling on the second day of the cycle, so pull, \npush and legs with off day coming back, pull,   push and legs. So, on the first push day, you \nhit your big exercise like your bench press,   and you do it for three to five sets. \nYou come up with a secondary chest   exercise and that would be for three sets.\nWhen you come back here the second time, we have   three exercises we could put in here. Because we \ncould basically say, hey, let's change the focus   of our big strength exercise to an overhead \npress and then just come in and fill in the gaps   with some secondary chest exercises. Three \nof them for three sets apiece. Again,   that puts you at nine sets and eight sets, \naround 17 sets for that type of split. \n  Now, if you follow a total body split, now we have \nset where we set up a Monday, Wednesday and Friday   workout schedule. And again, total body, meaning \ngoing to do everything in one particular workout.   So here for our pushing part of the workout, \nwe're going to want to train our shoulders,   are going to want to train our triceps. We're \ngoing to hit our chest likely here with a big   exercise. It might even come back again with a \nsecondary, fairly big exercise, like a dip. So,   you have a bench press for three to four sets or \nthree to five sets and then you have a weighted   dip coming in here. On the next time that we do \nthe push you can just come in with two accessory   type exercises for the chest here, just for \nadditional volume and just to continue to push   those hypertrophy gains with that 48 hour re \nhitting again of that same muscle group. \n  And then we come in 48 hours later, one more time \nand we can go back to the original exercise if we   so choose, in this case, the bench press again. \nBut all we have to do is the bench press and we   can hit some more shoulder and tricep work \nwhen we're talking about additional volume,   trying to bring up the overall \npushing aspect of our upper body.   And then we have to at least revisit this and \nthis the bro split. And you might be wondering   and maybe even understand by this point whether \nthe bro split actually can work. And I talk about   a dumb bro split and a smart bro split. And \na smart bro split, basically realizing that,   yeah, we're going to train chest on Monday, \nInternational Chest Day, and we're going to pick   four or five exercises for three sets a piece, \nwhich puts us at about 15 sets right there. \n  But if we know that we can hit them indirectly \nagain, we can hit the chest again and directly   through the exercises we choose for triceps. \nMaybe you do some sort of push up variation,   a cobra pushup for your triceps or you do some \nsort of a dip. We know we're going to indirectly   hit the chest again and we're going to pick \nup some additional volume through those two   exercises. And then we go through a leg workout, \nand we come back and hit the shoulders again.   So now we're kind of hitting the pushing aspect \nof it every other day and shoulder day again,   depending upon the exercises you choose, even in \noverhead press is going to hit the upper chest   or some variation, again, of a push up. \nWe had the opportunity to do this. And you can   see that we're restimulating that muscle every \n48 hours, but we're also hitting it indirectly,   even though we're putting the bulk of that \nworkload on this one day. Not saying this   is the best, I'm just saying that this is a way \nthat bro splits could actually work as well.   The fact is, when it comes to popular questions \nlike this in regard to training, guys,   there's never a clear-cut answer. It always sort \nof resides in the gray where a lot of different   factors matter, and particularly when you want to \nget the best results for you and you specifically,   those considerations have to be made.\nIf you're looking for programs guys that put   the science back in strength and consider all of \nthese elements and prescribing the workouts that   you do.
