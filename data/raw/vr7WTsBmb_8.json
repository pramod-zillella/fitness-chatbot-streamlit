    "transcript": "the follow-through jump out is an exercise that we used to develop and train the braking system of the shoulder sure it's important to develop the muscles that actually accelerate the shoulder and throw the ball but just as important is to develop the muscles that slow down the shoulder and protect it an exercise like this does just that what we have to do is anchor a tubing low to the ground about a foot or so off the ground we start in the cocking position so we get ourselves the point work in the calculation as if we're going to throw a baseball from here we actually jump out which is going to cause the band to be pulled back across our body you have to resist that apply the brakes back here slow it down so from here we're gonna jump and control it jump control it you're finishing it a nice follow-through position rotated towards your target and one more time use a fairly thick tubing for this to get an adequate pull in that direction it was too thin you won't find this that hard believe me it's hard"
