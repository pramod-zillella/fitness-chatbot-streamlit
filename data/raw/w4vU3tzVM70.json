    "transcript": "So, the One Arm Row is an absolute no for me,   putting it number one on my list \nof the worst back exercises. \n  What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. \nWhat you see behind me is a bunch of difference   back exercised. Many of which you're either have \ndone in the past or you're still doing right now.   But after today, you're going to want to get rid \nof a few of them. Because I'm going to help you to   rank them from the worst to the best, leaving you \nonly with the best back exercises that are going   to deliver the gains that you're after. \nAnd so, as we kick off this list here, it's   important to first define the criteria that goes \ninto the selection in the ranking of these back   exercises. First and foremost, are these exercises \ncapable of being progressively overloaded? And no,   this list is not being populated by those that \nare the best strength building exercises. But we   do know that strength leads to hypertrophy, \nwhich is the main focus of the list. \n  Secondly, we know that the back has a lot of \nmuscles in it. This particular episode here   is going to focus on those that are doing the \nbest job of helping you to build bigger lats.   Future breakdowns in the series can focus on the \nother areas of the back, like the upper back and   traps or maybe even the lower back. But for \nhere, we're really looking at the lats.\n  And finally, guys, is the exercise safe? A \nlot of people will perform any exercise in   the pursuit of gains. But here on this channel is \na physical therapist, I have to consider safety.   I'm going to build that into the selection \ncriteria for every one of these exercises. \n  And so now with the groundwork laid, it's time \nto start working from the bottom up. The worst   category here. And I'm looking at my number \none no, and it's a version of the row,   t's the One Arm Dumbbell Row. You see, I don't \ndislike the unilateral aspect of the exercise,   that's not it. But when you put one knee \nup on the bench as you do, this is actually   introducing a stress to the groin that I've \ntalked about in many of those before that I'm   just not comfortable with. Literally, as I've \ngiven myself two hernias from the exercise. \n  You put an asymmetrical strain on the inguinal \ncanal, which is oftentimes a weak spot for men as   it is, which can oftentimes lead to the hernias \nthat we don't want. The big thing about it,   though, is we have better options that don't \nrequire us to have one knee up on the bench.   We'll get back to that in a second, but for \nnow, the One Arm Row is an absolute no for me,   putting it number one on my list \nof the worst back exercises. \n  So now making our way up through the worst \nexercises for your back, we have to look next   to the Lat Pulldown. But no, not any version of \nLat Pulldown, but the Behind the Neck version of   Lat Pulldown, because where you pull to makes all \nthe difference in the world. See, this variation   takes those elbows out of the scapular plane, the \nnatural plane they prefer to move in, angled about   45 degrees forward and flares them far too much \nout to the side. And what that does is it forces   the shoulder into a lot of internal rotation. \nWell, those arms are up overhead internal rotation   with elevation can lead to impingement problems. \nGuys, do me a favor and put that bar in front   of the body and put this exercise at the top of \nyour list of ones to skip with the big red X. \n  And so, with that I get to break out my blue \nmarker now as we work our way up the rankings into   the Better Category, good exercises, but still \nwith limitations. And the first one we look at   is the Renegade Row. And while this does allow \nus to hit the lats through a rolling motion,   we have to look beyond that because we're being \ncompromised by the load we can actually use on   the exercise due to more of that instability. \nNow, we're not talking about that asymmetrical   lower body instability that we have for the One \nArm Dumbbell Row, but we're just shifting it up   the kinetic chain into the core.\nAnd if your core is weak,   you're not going to be able to lift a lot in this \nexercise. So, if we're looking for hypertrophy,   we're undermining our ability to achieve it by \nintroducing a variable that really doesn't have   to be there in the first place. And also, the row \nitself, the range of motion is being cut short by   the floor. Unless you want to use your front \ndelt to lift the dumbbell out in front of you   to increase that lat stretch, you're limiting \nyour ability to take advantage of the stretch   reflex that can produce more gains as well. Guys, \nfor all of these reasons, though, the exercise is   one I program myself, mostly in circuits or \nmetabolic type workouts. The exercise for   hypertrophy is limited and therefore it deserves \nthe blue circle here for better just not great.\n  Moving on in the Better Category here, \nit actually pains me to see this exercise   sit so low on the list, but we're talking about \nthe Deadlift. Look, remember the criteria here   lat development. And while the Deadlift itself \nrequires a lapse to be completely engaged in   order to keep that bar tight to your body, \nit does so through an isometric contraction   that doesn't necessarily lead to the greatest \noverall hypertrophy gains for the lats. \n  Now, ironically, we look at the muscle gains \nin the upper back and traps through the same   isometric contraction. Those tend to be better. \nBut again, we're going to reserve that for a later   video. But suffice it to say that even though the \nDeadlift is one of the greatest exercises of all   time when it comes to lat development, it doesn't \ncheck all the boxes and therefore it just gets the   blue circle for the Better Category. \nAnd next up here, the Better Category,   we have another exercise like the Deadlift that \nstarts from the floor but does a much better   job of hitting the lats, but not without its \ndrawbacks. We're talking about the Pendlay Row.   And here we have to look at the risk and reward \nof the exercise. Does the reward of pulling the   bar through a greater range of motion off of the \nfloor outweigh the risk of attempting to do so   with a body not prepared to do that? \nYou see the slightest bit of hamstring   inflexibility, or a lack of lumbar extension \nmobility is going to compromise your ability   to perform this safely. Even though we can \nbetter target the lats from this completely   horizontal position, at what risk are we doing \nit. When we realize again that there's better   options by simply shifting your torso slightly \nhigher, I just can't make this exercise rise   too far up the list, so therefore it's going \nto sit here in the Better Category only. \n  And so now I get to break out my yellow marker \nas we continue our way up the rankings, this   time into the Better Still Category. And for the \nfirst exercise here, I want to look right here at   the Tripod Row because this one actually gives us \na chance to correct some of the things, we didn't   like about some of the previous exercises, namely \nthe One Arm Dumbbell Row and that Pendlay Row   we just covered. What do we have here? Well, we \nhave asymmetrical loading now being symmetrically   loaded across the lower body. Because all we have \nto do is take that knee off of the bench and just   put ourselves in this position with one hand \nstabilizing our upper body. And doing just this,   again, allows that symmetrical loading of \nthose pelvic muscles that don't now have   to undergo any of those stresses that we don't \nwant to introduce. Regarding the Pendlay Row,   I actually have a chance to achieve as much of \na horizontal position as I want on this exercise   because I have the additional upper body support \nthat allows me to do so without putting my lower   back at risk. All in all, this is a simple tweak \nto make that take some of those limitations   and now puts them in your favor and puts this as \nthe first in the category of Better Still. \n  Moving on in the Better Still Category, we have \nan exercise here that not only allows us to target   the lats well but introduce an all important \ncomponent that gets overlooked in our training   called straight arm scapular strength. We're \ntalking about the Straight Arm Pushdown. Now,   we talked about the benefit of having the \nlats involved in the deadlift and their   ability to stabilize that lift. This puts \nus in that same position, but it gets us   there dynamically. The lats are working to \npull that arm out from the front your body   down to your side, allowing us to focus on the \nadduction function of the lats and minimize some   of those other back muscles that oftentimes \nlike to kick in on those back exercises. \n  That being said, you have to make sure you're \npaying attention to the exercise name itself,   the Straight Arm Pushdown and a little bit of \nbend in the elbow here is going to invite the   desire of the triceps to kick in and help \nyou do the exercise. If you pay attention   to how it's performed, then it deserves its spot \nhere squarely in the Better Still Category. \n  And so, if you watch my chest exercises ranked \nfrom best to worst, you have watched all the   ones in the series, right? Well, if not, I'll link \ntwo of them for you at the end of this video and   then just make sure you're subscribed so you \nnever miss any of them when I put one out.\n  Now, you might be wondering what this next \nexercise is doing in the back exercise   video and we're talking about the Dumbbell \nPullover. You see, how you perform an exercise   determines what muscles work. When we do the \nDumbbell Pullover with the focus being the lats,   we want to make sure that we flare those elbows \nout way out to the side. Now the benefit of this   exercise is the stretch that we can achieve \non the lats by doing it. If we can increase   the stretch, we can increase the recruitment \ncapabilities of the lats on the exercise. \n  Now how do we do it? Well, we simply \nlet those arms drop back over our head.   But what if we have limited shoulder mobility? \nWe still have a safe alternative. You just simply   drop your hips down lower, realizing that we \ncan take the attachment points of the pelvis   and the arm and stretch them out away from each \nother without having to go into a limitation and   mobility that just doesn't allow us to. The point \nis this exercise has been a staple that developer   for many, many years because it can deliver \nthe gains if you know how to perform it right.   The Dumbbell Pullover gets another yellow \ncircle here for a Better Still exercise. \n  Interestingly, for your body weight guys out \nthere, you actually too can get the benefits   of this exercise without even having to own a \nsingle dumbbell. You can do the Human Pullover.   And what this does is it takes a concept that is \ntough for me to grasp the relative motion concept.   And instead of moving your arms on a fixed \nbody like you would do in a Dumbbell Pullover,   you move your body on fixed arms, \nbut the arms are doing all the work.   The abs here are stabilizing your body in space, \nbut the arms are pulling as hard as they possibly   can in order to lift the weight of your body, \neffectively allowing you to place a great overload   on the last and allowing them to grow even when \nyou don't have access to any equipment. \n  And lastly, the Better Still Category we have \nanother variation of the row, and this time we're   talking about, the Seated Cable Row. And right off \nthe bat, we actually know we can use some heavy   weights here. Why? Because we can utilize our legs \nto help us a bit and let the eccentric focus of   the exercise take over. By allowing our legs to \nhelp us push and then control on that eccentric,   we get the overload every single time we allow our \narms to reach out in front of our body. That being   said, I would prefer that you use a V handle here, \nif possible, because we realize we're not going to   have that wraparound benefit of the lats with any \nof the handles that we use. And if you introduce   something like a straight bar, you're going to \nget those arms into further extension, yes, but   that's going to kick in the rear delts more.\nThe rear delts being weaker than the lats is   going to limit the amount of weight you can use. \nSo, the V handle works nicely here. Just be sure   that when you are reaching forward here, you're \nnot allowing the low back to round with you.   Keep that low back and a good, firm, safe \nposition and you'll get all the benefits   this exercise has to provide and put it right \nhere firmly in the Better Still Category. \n  And so now I get to break out my green marker \nas we continue to work our way up the rankings,   this time to the Almost Best Category, all great \nexercises that allow me to showcase that wrap   around capability of the lats that I mentioned. \nAnd I also now get to kick this off by showcasing   one of the best to ever do this, John Meadows. \nYou see the Meadows Row named after him,   gives you the chance to really feel like your \nelbow is moving through space in a way that   doesn't put any stress on your shoulder. \nAnd as I mentioned before, you're allowed   to do this out of that tripod setup with both \nfeet on the floor, avoiding that asymmetrical   loading that we always try to avoid from any \nother type of row. Beyond that, guys it's not   just a great exercise, but it's named after a \ngreat man. John Meadows was a friend of mine,   and he had that fitness education first focus \non his channel, always staying out of the drama,   something I think we can all respect. That's \nwhy the Meadows Row here belongs as my first   in the category of the Almost Best.\nContinuing now with the Almost Best Category,   we actually have probably my favorite \nexercise of all time when it comes to   back exercises. It's just not ranking all the \nway at the top because it requires a machine   that not everybody has. We're talking about \nthe One Arm High Cable Row. But once again,   the wrap around capability of the lats is built \ninto this exercise, not to mention the ability   to stretch out the origin insertion of the lat to \ntheir maximum. When you reach out all the way in   front of your body, you have the distance between \nthat pelvis and the arm as far as it can possibly   be intensifying that stretch to a level you \nreally can't achieve on any other exercise. \n  And again, we can take that unilateral benefit \nand really focus on developing the lats,   overcoming any imbalances you might \nhave. If you have access to the machine,   this is going to be a must do exercise. If \nyou don't, I've got you covered, but it still   belongs here in the Almost Best Category. \nAnd so, you might have been taken aback when   I mentioned the Lat Pulldown being in the \nWorst Category of back exercises. However,   as always, how you do what you do matters. And \nwhen we talk about doing the exercise properly,   it makes the Lat Pulldown rise all \nthe way up to the top of the list,   this time to the Almost Best Category. You see \nputting those elbows out in front of your body   not only gives them a better mechanical \nadvantage to ironically pull more, but   it does so once again out of that safe position \nto allow you to do this for years to come. \n  Not to mention, the exercise is entirely \nscalable. With the simple shift of a weight   pin in the stack, you can match not only \nthe level of strength you have right now   but allow you to progressively load it to get \nto new strength levels and with that new gains.   If you're interested in a little experimentation \nto see even better lat gains, then I invite you to   try the Rocking Pulldown variation I've covered \nbefore. This gives us that chance once again   to get that wraparound capability of the lats \ntied into the movement as well by simply pulling   a little bit harder on one side of the bar than \nthe other as you bring it down. Either way here,   guys, the Lat Pulldown is a classic for \na reason, and it belongs here squarely   at the top in the Almost Best Category.\nAnd wrapping up our exercises in the Almost   Best Category four back. We've got one here \nthat ironically doesn't get as benefits from   the wraparound function of the lats, but through \nits capability for overload and momentum to drive   your gains. We're talking about the Dead Row. The \nopportunity to load this exercise up and then take   advantage of the momentum the legs generate \nfrom below gives us a chance to experience   a heavier eccentric on the way down. Not to \nmention it's a great athletic exercise. \n  It's an explosive movement, and dare I say \na fun one, that gives us a chance to learn   how to move our bodies explosively through \nspace from our feet to our fingertips. Guys,   the Dead Row belongs here for me at the top \nof the top and the Almost Best Category.\n  So, I mentioned the top of the top, but only \none could be at the top of the best of the best   when it comes to the best exercises for your \nback. Or is that two? You see, in this case,   we've got two spots here, the Weighted Pullup \nand the Barbell Row that are going to share   the top spot and earn that Green Star. See, we're \ntalking about first the Barbell Row being the   best option for building your back without the \ndeficits we talked about, maybe with the Pendlay   Row. The Barbell Row gives you that option to \nmaximally overload the lats while still having   an eye towards the safety of the exercise. \nNow, if your lower back is still something of   concern, you could always do the exercise in a \nchest supported fashion, which is still going to   give you all the benefits on the lats but provide \na little bit more support for those that need it.   Now, talking about the vertical pulling exercise, \nguys, it's the Weighted Pullup that wins for me.   And again, you have to do both, so that's why \nwe're linking them here. The Weighted Pullup   gives you the chance to add weight if able, so \nthat you can overload the exercise once again. And   the fact that the accessibility of the exercise \nis much higher than having to have access to a Lat   Pulldown machine is going to make it my top choice \nwhen it comes to vertical pull movements.\n  Guys, the back is a big place but when we \nknow how to navigate through the exercise   options to leave you with only the ones \nthat are going to deliver the best gains,   well, then you're ahead of the game.\nIf you're looking to see where other   exercises rank for other muscle groups then \nI want you to check out our chest exercises   ranked video here and our tricep exercises \nranked here.
