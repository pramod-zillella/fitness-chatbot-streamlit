    "transcript": "isolation is a double-edged sword to some it could create loneliness to others it provides an opportunity to reflect on the gifts that we've received and to show gratitude for life's blessings it's simply a matter of perspective quarantine buddy Oh too close don't worry about sorry about that hey you know I was really worried about this whole quarantine thing but we have to hang out together every day and you get so much time for fun activities six-feet social distancing I got you I got social distancing hey do you want it or a pizza do you think they still deliver Chinese what do you mean you don't have a good home gym what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com either current circumstances have you training at home more often than you'd like to or maybe actually like to train at home but either way what if you don't think you have enough what if you think you're leaving gains on the table because of the current circumstances so now I want try to open your eyes I'm giving you 29 workout hacks to give you a lot more opportunities and a lot more exercises that maybe you never thought of before that means say guys we got a lot of work to cover a lot of things to show you so let's start doing that all right so the great place to start is actually here in the kitchen just maybe skip the trip to the refrigerator first but really you've got a wealth of opportunity right here at your kitchen counter or anything that has a corner here you could do a whole bunch of exercises just like this you can do dips one of my favorite places to do them you can position your body more upright to focus on triceps or you can just turn around and do hanging exercises for your abs and when you don't with that you could actually just head over to your kitchen table and do all kinds of rows wider rows underhand chin curls there's a lot of stuff here you can do guys in your kitchen you just got to open your mind to the possibilities when you're in a gym you have access to either a bench or a plyo box to do all kinds of step ups or box jumps or different things for your legs you have the same capability here if you just look at your own staircase you see we can do all these different variations simply by taking advantage of the height elevation on the steps making it more difficult by jumping up two steps at one time we're actually stepping up two steps at one time whatever it is guys its provides you with an opportunity to work not just your lower body but also your upper body to decline push up to one of the better ways to train your upper chest and all you got to do is utilize your own staircase to get them done so you might be thinking about now but I miss my weights my dumbbells what can I do I don't have anything around my house that's really that heavy well what if you get a hold of one of these this here give you some good weight this is a 40 pound jug of water here from whoever you want to order from the fact is you can do a lot with these guys even has its own built-in handle to make it a lot easier to get the job done so with that handle it's pretty obvious that we can do this I carry one of my favorite exercises you don't need a lot of room you don't need to be walking around you can simply walk back and forth if needed and you could also do some of these other exercises like the clean or even the shoulder press up and over we call this a grave digger it's definitely challenging with this weight and you can certainly work your abs here too it's a heavier than normal implement but it still gets the job done on the Russian twist and of course you got to deal with that slosh factor here but that's a little added element of stability right you got to slow down that rep to make sure that you're in control at all times and that's not really a bad thing the next valuable element in your house you probably have a few of actually in their doorways and it actually provides you with an opportunity to work that area of your body that tends to be more difficult to work at home and that's your back but you see we have some options we even can do some work for our shoulders too but you see I like the doorway here because as long as you have a stable jamb here you could do either a chin up off of it or you could turn around and do a pull-up but beyond that we have some other waves too that we can work our back this here is a variation of a row but it does require that you have a step down on the other side of the door so you can create that leverage to actually make the back muscles work but beyond that too I mentioned the shoulders all you got to do is press into this to get an isometric contraction for the deltoids we actually have this built into our zero programme as sort of an isometric finisher after doing some of your handstand push-up work the fact is there's a lot of things you can do here in a doorway again pretty much all of us have access to at least one now for this one we probably think that Jesse's the best videographer in the world but actually he's the best mop cleaner in the world you see he does a fantastic job on this gym but you don't need to just use the mop to clean you see this is one of the most versatile things that you can actually use in your own home you see if you take it pro over the back of a couple of chairs you instantly got the opportunity to do more of that elusive back work that we just talked about you can do all kinds of rows you could train your biceps with inverted chin curls you've got some options here that you just didn't have access to if you didn't have anything that you could actually pull yourself on this is a hell of a lot sturdier than you think and beyond that you can actually do some ab work we've covered before the value of the see that I've twist done more slowly it's not just exercise that you could benefit from here you can use this to do stretching and mobilization work to right showed you guys too many times the value of mobilizing the thoracic spine and this provides you with the perfect opportunity to do it the right way or even the perfect morning stretch for you to do no matter what it is guys don't undervalue the benefit here of a simple broomstick now for the next one here maybe you don't have a dog but it might be worth asking a friend if you could have one of their extra dog leaves just because this will turn to the best exercises you could possibly do at home especially for adding muscle the pull-up and the dip and two weighted versions of the pull-up and dip you simply thread the dog leash through the weight you hook it to itself you put it around your waist and you're good to go but beyond that it has some other things you can do here too again versatility is key when you're training at home you can simply wrap the dog leash over a pull-up bar and now you have a form of assisted stretching right passively allowing yourself to pull down with one arm to get the other one into a greater stretch and you can get to on your own or you can take that same leash hook it to itself go back and grab that mop from Jessi again if you have to and then we have the opportunity to create a simulation of a TRX where we can do more bodyweight rowing and exercises that we would normally do with suspension trainers guys just open up your mind to the possibilities around you and all new exercises are going to be at your feet so maybe you've seen people use these sliders right to do exercises like Jesse's doing here different lunge variations different push-up variations maybe even some ab work some AB real rollout substitutions here look I'm not trying to take business away from anybody but honestly if you got a couple Tupperware covers at home it's gonna do the same thing the next one is one of my favorite ways to actually overload the posterior chain and we featured it a lot on this channel for good reason and it's a slick floor now look it could be a tile floor it could be a hardwood floor it could be anything that you can actually slide your feet on you can actually just have your socks on here to make it even easier the point is that you can do exercise like I'm showing you here my favorite which is the hamstring bridge and curl because it gives you a chance to make that hamstring and glute work together as opposed to letting the hamstring dominate and leaving the glutes to do less of the work like they often do we also could work our upper body to not just doing ab work like you see me here but also one of my favorite exercises which is working our back this is a great back pullover simulation exercise there's so many things you can do here just by being able to slide on a surface and I'm sure you could find one somewhere in your house like I said either of tile or wood and last but not least we can't forget perhaps the most valuable piece of equipment that you have around your house especially during times like these guys and it's your laptop computer look having access to workouts like we put here up on our channel is going to give you guys an opportunity to at least have the information now the next part is what you do with it I'm encouraging you guys don't let this get you down the fact that you're not in your gym right now doesn't mean that you should stop working out entirely you have so many things you can do we actually put together for you the perfect home workout that you can do step by step and also I have a complete zero program at our athlean-x comm website which includes a meal plan - guys no stone left unturned either option is a great way for you to get going - make sure you don't let those gains go by the wayside if you found the video helpful guys leave your comments and thumbs up let me know so
