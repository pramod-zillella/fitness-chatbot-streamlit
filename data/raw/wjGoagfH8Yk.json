    "transcript": "what's the gravity of cavaliere athleanx.com have you noticed that your gains have stopped maybe even suddenly this video is going to help you to identify what's happening and more importantly to turn around so to get this topic started here I figure let's talk to somebody whose gains have stopped Jesse once you come on in let's talk to everybody about gains have stopped come on gains in your head oh geez by the way I got my new intro already brought it within our world oh we're not going through a movie trailer I didn't spot you were supposed to be creating a movie trailer and this tool is too long about the abridged version not the lights I don't want any immersion okay here's the abridged version run it that is ridiculous over-the-top that is much I paid you for that time to write that and work on that you know okay I'm open to criticism is it too absurd too many explosions not enough sharks what is it it's just ridiculous so should I work on more sophistication how about not how about you work okay just work you know what let's improve this Ricky here instantly improve we just improve that at least right guys let's talk about these gains what's happening here let's break them down one by one I remember when you first started working out it was actually like fun because you were gaining strength that you can actually see the gains almost from session to session every time you go to benchpress you were like adding full plates big plates to the bar what what happened it just doesn't continue to do that doesn't mean that your gains have stopped completely no it's that strength gains are harder to come by as you get more experienced but it doesn't mean you should stop chasing them in other words in good form as always you still want to continue to try to progressively overload and as you get more experienced it has to come in the form of smaller and smaller plates don't discredit the value of a two and a half pound plate it can provide that necessary impetus to get over the hump and to get those gains kick-started again don't just get comfortable where you're at find a way to add a small plate to the end of that bar to kick-start those gains once again all reason the number two actually also has to do with strength it is that strength became your only focus guys I've talked about all the time here on this channel if you want to look like an athlete you have to Train like an athlete unless you're only a strength athlete then you have to have other weapons in your arsenal you have to train for hypertrophy you have to train for conditioning you have to train for these other elements but you have to make sure that you're making decisions that actually go together see we know that there's a good relationship between strength training and hypertrophy training because as you add more muscle through hypertrophy training you're going to increase your strength as you add more strength you're going to add more muscle they're related bouncing around the gym and doing things like this aren't necessarily a related plan it's lacking a plan it's just being having training a TD we want to make sure that at all times you're having a plan and there's no such thing as what people say interference if they're all on the same page in terms of breeding and more multi-dimensional version of you creating a more athletic version of you that can do multiple things instead of excelling in just one the next one here is interesting because it happens to a lot of us because the things we did in the past worked but that doesn't mean it's always going to continue to work and I'm talking about nutrition maybe you're even eating perfectly clean you're eating great but are you eating enough particularly if you're adding new lean muscle the more muscle tissue you add the more you're going to have to support that not only just to continue to maintain what you have but to continue to add more so there always has to be some sort of an adjustment period made to your nutrition if you want to continue to make those gains let me lay out a scenario for you let's say when you first started and worked out your eating let's just say three meals a day and they're of a certain size and you were told that you need to eat more so you started to add more food to each of those meals so they got larger and you started to gain muscle but then you realized that you really couldn't even support any more food at each meal you just felt too full so one of the only ways that you could actually increase the food intake over the course of a day was to maybe add a couple meals or snacks to the equation and then you started to make more gains again and at that point you started maybe plateau so you slowly started to add to the size of those meals too and ultimately all the meals started to get bigger and you were able to support new muscle gains the point is guys you need to continue to make adjustments the rock and Jeff Cavaliere don't have the same nutritional requirements in a given day what's needed to sustain his physique is going to be different than what's needed to sustain my physique the point is you have to ask yourself are you eating enough today to sustain what it is that you require to continue to make gains when games come to a halt one of the areas I ask you to look at closely right off the bat is how well you're sleeping because we know that gains are made away from the gym when our muscles are recovering particularly during sleep and if you are not sleeping well or your sleep is cut back significantly from times in the past it's going to have an impact on you and it usually happens really fast so evaluate your sleep we know that the amount of good quality sleep is really correlated directly with the amount of gains that you can make in the gym simply because we're allowing the muscles that we beat and created the stimulus for growth to actually benefit from that stimulus and growth by allowing the body to recover check your sleep patterns guys make sure it's both good and long enough to allow you to make the gains that you should be making speaking of checking you also want to make sure you check your expectations what how much muscle do you think you should be building right now are you gaining a couple pounds but you think that that's not enough it could be perhaps because you're watching the wrong people on YouTube maybe you think that you're do another 20 pounds of muscle in year two another 25 pounds of muscle in year 3 that's wrong expectations set by bad information you see when you make your early gains guys you're going to experience them more rapidly because your body is not accustomed to the stimulus of training and as you train and gain more experience those gains are going to slow down but that's normal if your expectations are in line with that and you realize that hey a 2 pound or a three pound muscle gain this year would be really good then your expectations or your disappointments because it's not 15 don't really exist because they're really not founded in anything real make sure you know where you're at in terms of your personal training history and your journey and that will have a lot to do with expectations that you should set for yourself and more importantly the disappointments you're going to blame yourself for if they're not as rapid as you think they should be this one here is one of my favorites because it requires that we get honest with ourselves and actually ask ourselves do we really know what intense training is do we know what applying a high effort level is to our training and we may not because you might have heard from other people that the best way to gain is to simply just accumulate a lot of volume at a lower effort level not low but lower and I'm here to tell you that the best way to gain muscle is to increase your effort level every single time to push as if it's the only set you're going to do and force your body into new growth why because accumulating jump volume has a lot of downsides especially when it comes to the athletic population guys that actually need to be able to get out on the field and exert volume in other ways to be athletic to play their sport they're not looking to accumulate a lot of time in the gym add it on to that there's only so much we can recover from so what I'm suggesting is you train in the workout length the unnecessary for more effort in the volume that you perform that is where the gains will lie if you're stuck in that realm here where you're looking a little bit more like this too casual too easy you finish your set and you can go have a coffee and maybe smoke a cigarette actually - bad idea the coffee's okay bad idea with the cigarettes you want to look more like this you want to look like you're actually trying you want to feel like you're trying you want to give your muscles a reason to grow you want to force the stimulus upon them they haven't necessarily felt before so that they have a reason to come back and get stronger and bigger and more resilient to the stresses you just applied to them there's no way around that guys and I'm telling you as a natural athlete who has limited recovery this is going to be the better way to do this forget all that extra volume forget all the extra junk volume and focus more on what's going to get the job done today to get you further ahead than where you are right now and our last reason here is perhaps you've actually overlooked the value of my muscle connected training meaning have you actually focused on what you're doing in there exercises that you're performing have you tried to focus on the quality of every contraction because when you do that effort level we just talked about watch these skyrocket will go through the roof when you're focused on really trying to contract the muscle you're trying to contract you'll be shocked at how much less you can probably lift and how many fewer reps you could probably perform and that's not a bad thing it's actually good because once again the stimulus is all that matters the tension is all that matters accumulating more attention because you're increasing the effort in this case through more focused effort on the muscle you're trying to build to actually contract it's all a good thing guys it's going to help you to get through that hurdle and that hump that's holding you back right now your gains are sitting there right on the other side of that hump but you've got to be willing to push through it and over it and focusing more on every single repetition of what you're doing is going to allow you to make gains that you maybe thought we're in the past so they have a guy seven reasons that your muscle gains and may have stopped are you backing your insufferable they ran out of supplements that's the bonus reason where did you get those from by the way put those back I ordered these rubber let's get out of here okay now he's got a point though if you know well only if your nutrition isn't on point and your training is on point yes supplements will add to that if you're looking for supplements guys we have the best in the business athlete rx so that being said guys the reason is for why your days have stopped might require you to look yourself in the mirror and say hey yeah I think this is maybe what's going on now I don't think that you can make muscle gains on end forever but I do think that when they stop completely there's always a reason for and I think we uncovered one of the reasons here or maybe multiple reasons that you can address in the meantime you're looking for programs that map it all out for you in a step-by-step progressive way to minimize those stalls you can head to athleanx.com right now in the meantime if you found the video helpful leave your comments and thumbs up below let me know some over to cover I'll do my best to do that for you and if you haven't already done so click Subscribe and turn it on for Taoiseach so you never miss a new video when we put one out alright guys see you soon [Music]"
