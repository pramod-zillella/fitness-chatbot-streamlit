    "transcript": "what's up guys jeff cavaliere athleanx.com so today we're going to continue our popular best dumbbell exercise series this time for your abs that's right your abs because you actually can use dumbbells to train your abs a matter of fact you should be using dumbbells to train your abs if you want the best looking abs because just like any other muscle in your body this particular muscle group will respond to overload and we can do it with a dumbbell now are there other ways to overload your abdominal muscles of course there are you can use a med ball like I've done here on Instagram if you haven't already followed us guys you can one make sure you do at athlean-x which requires that you be a quick explosive and powerful but it's not going to appear in this video because we're limiting ourselves to dumbbells another alternative here that I also showcased on instagram was this plate drag then I have a plank position it's definitely something you can use to create a strength overload but as I said we've limited the exercise selections to dumbbells and we're not sacrificing in doing so I am going to pick the best exercise for each of the following categories the best strength exercise the best for power for hypertrophy the best total body ab exercise of the dumbbell it actually exists something for more of a correct abuse metabolic exercise and then one that doesn't really fit any of the categories here but is no less important and that is our best miscellaneous exercise the fact is guys as we always have done here we're gonna put the science behind the strength why we select what we select with that being said let's keep this list off right with a best exercise for strength all right so when we're talking about AB strength here there's something we probably have all experienced first hand and that is whenever we move our legs towards our head versus our head towards our legs it's a hell of a lot harder and the reason for that is because we're not as strong as we think we are the weight of our legs alone is oftentimes enough to overload those movements to make them a challenge however it doesn't mean that you're trying to shy away from adding external load if possible mad at matter of fact you can do this with a couple of different exercise selections I do think there's a difference between the strength we have in our ABS when we move from the top down for the very reasons I just explained so I would separate this selection into two choices the first one would be when we come from the top down this exercise here the oldest up we simply have one dumbbell in your hand and the only challenge is to get to a halt sitting position here and then lower yourself back down slowly eccentric ly under control of the ABS then we swap hands we come back again you can see that the legs are not participating here they're spread out they're not pushing down to the floor the feet aren't flat I'm getting no extra contribution I'm making my ABS do all of the work now if we wanted to overload the bottom-up movement a lot of us might run over to this exercise here that hang a leg raise and throw a dumbbell between our feet but if you're doing this right here then you really not strengthen your abdominal muscles instead you're strengthening your hip flexors which is going to cause a problem down the road particularly maybe in the form of some low back pain because you're just lifting at the hips as opposed to doing this and that is actually trunk curling curling from the pelvis causing flexion of the spine with the strength of the abdominals but I wouldn't even suggest this be the exercise of choice instead I would do this here and this is a dragon thrust and what we do is we set ourselves up with the dumbbell between our feet anchor ourselves to something sturdy behind us and then you simply just try to lift the pelvis up all that action of getting the pelvis lifted into the air is going to be the tremendous responsibility of the lower abs and then when you extend your legs out you're making the moment arm longer making it more of a challenge for the ABS but you get that relief of being able to bring it back temporarily some will find that they'll be able to actually do some repetitions here and create some additional overload that they might not have been able to do here either correctly or even at all on the hanging leg raise so it comes to power now we have to introduce something else not just the ability to move some weight or to have some external force that we can overcome but can we actually overcome it quickly can we do it in an explosive manner that is where power is and we can do this here with this dumbbell twisting toe tap so I almost preset the ABS I preload them because of the rotation stretch I get by dropping the dumbbell down to the side and then I come up and I lift by moving both the top and the bottom together to meet in the middle and then I reload on the opposite side again I'm getting the stretch reflex from both sides here and I come back up touch the toe on the other side and repeat again there's coordination and synchronization between the lower and the top half and more importantly there's the overcoming of an external load speed this is where power is at and I invite you guys to try this exercise and you're gonna love it so when it comes to hypertrophy that's actually something you should not avoid when it comes to the abdominal muscles a lot of us think I don't want to get big ass because they're gonna become bloated looking that's not actually true at all remember if we're lean enough the development of the ABS the hypertrophy of the abdominal muscles is going to create abs that pop abs that are more visible and my favorite way to do that here is with the weighted levitation crunch now this is a slow movement this is one we're not moving very much at all but it has the incredible benefit of an overloaded East centric and we do that because we introduced this physio ball and when we land the physio ball you can see that when I lay back over it I'm getting a stretch on the ABS I'm getting an exaggerated stretch on the ABS then I then have to come out of that elongation that eccentric contraction in the ABS is something we don't often get especially when you think about the fact that most of our ab exercises are done flat on the floor and we can't go past the neutral position on the ball we can when we come out of this every single contraction should be purposeful you should think about trying to contract each row of the ABS the top the middle bottom each row one at a time to really get an intense contraction both of those elements are something that we're really helpful when it comes to building muscle we know that an intentional contraction and the introduction of the eccentric overload or both elements are going to help us to do exactly that to grow your abs to ultimately make them look better so when we're attempting to create a metabolic overload with an exercise we generally pick an exercise that allows for a full range of motion and lots of contractions and as that burn accumulates we realize that it's coming from an accumulation of metabolites hydrogen ions lactic acid things that actually start to accumulate within the muscle that make us want to cry and stop in the goal being continue don't cry don't stop keep pushing and that's where the gains are best had well we can do that here with ABS but I suggest something slightly different instead of trying to get a bunch of repetitions of flexing and extending why don't we spend a little bit more time and for stabilizing the spine but still creating a challenge then we're going to want to resist that burn on and we can best do it here with one of two options number on this exercise here called rock the boat this is actually an isometric challenge for the ABS that is preventing movement rotation and actually extension through this one stable position where I try to challenge myself left and right now the goal again gives not stopping when it just starts to burn but continuing as long as I can preventing the breakdown of this stable position at any point during the exercise and if you don't feel like doing this you can try this instead this is a hollow rock done with a dumbbell and the idea being here once again as you lock yourself into the position and you're using the overload of the dumbbell to challenge this position even further look people do this exercise without a dumbbell at all it's still challenging the idea being you're going to reach that metabolic overload a bit faster because the demands on the muscle are greater the goal here is just to get in this position stay stable and rock and keep going and resist that burn rep after rep after rep never compromising the stability of your core in the process guys both of these options are good ones whichever one you pick I promise you're gonna get good results from it alright so moving on now we have our total body exercise and who would have thought there's a great dumbbell exercise that's going to hit your abs but everything else in the process well there is and it's this exercise right here it's the dumbbell overhead walk now look anytime we elongated body we're creating an instability of our entire body but if I wanted you to become as stable as possible you might even do this and really crunch down and stay tight but as soon as I make you as long as I can I've introduced a destabilization well guess what the ABS do really really well they create stability so if we do this exercise like this we're going to have to have stability created instantly to be able to allow us to walk steadily to allow us to keep those arms up as tall as possible overhead and to create the ability to not have a leaning left and right or twisting or falling forward or backwards all of this is a responsibility of the abdominal muscles and we're going to challenge them really really well with this one simple exercise simply walk around the gym your house whatever available space you have with a pair of dumbbells up overhead with a combined weight that's about a quarter of your body weight and just keep walking stay tall stay focused and try this exercise I promise you do good things for you so when it comes to the corrective exercise selection here you've probably figured he's got to go for the back and you're right I am but I'm not going to go at it in the way that you think we do a lot of lumbar strengthening in our athlean-x programs and here on this channel but what we don't do that much of is actually stretching the muscles of the low back that do tend to get tight a lot of times as compensation for other areas that aren't working right so this exercise here is great for that and this is the dumbbell ab roll-up the purpose here of the dumbbell is to create a couple of things number one it actually assists us in getting to the top and assists us in getting a stretch on the hamstrings and on that low back in this forward position as we go back down it actually becomes an eccentric challenge for us as we try to paint one segment at a time back down to the floor it creates control at every segment demanding that we have the ability to lay down one vertebra at a time which is something that doesn't often happen you'll see people clunk down to the floor because they overexert their abs at some position on the way back they just don't have the strength there's now you can see I'll drop the dumbbell here at the end and just do a couple to really rip out and really explore that flexibility that I've just gained from this one simple exercise and now finally we have that miscellaneous category where I get to hit sort of the other muscles that don't get the love that these specific ab exercises are giving us and this exercise is one of my all-time favorites it is the weighted gymnast ab tuck I have covered this exercise many times on this channel because of how good it is but it's got so many factors that make it good it's got not only this bottom up tuck this posterior tilt of the pelvis being loaded now with the dumbbell it's also got the fact that we can include twisting and rotation which immediately as you see here is going to involve the obliques we know how crucial the interaction between the obliques and abdominal muscles is so why not train it and we could do it so well with this and not just that to be able to keep our body in this position and stay tall as the pelvis is coming up we're also overloading the all-important muscle that also gets overlooked and it's the serratus anterior so we get that sort of triple threat going on here one exercise making it the perfect exercise for this miscellaneous category in the perfect way to complete and round out our seven selections so they have the guys my best dumbbell exercise selections for abs and as I mentioned the open if it's not something you're doing now make sure you introduce them soon like today because these are going to provide a benefit that's unique and different than anything you're getting right now if you aren't doing weighted ab exercises if you're looking for an app that's right we have an app that actually combines all of these exercises as an option into an entire eight-week ab training cycle you can get it over in the app store the 6-pack promise and also in the Android store the six-pack promise in the meantime you're looking for more than just abs as I hope you are you can find all of our step-by-step programs with the same level of science pull into the selection of every exercise we make in all of our programs over at
