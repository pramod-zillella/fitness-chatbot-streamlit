    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today we’re finally going to clear the air.\nWhat are my stats? What’s my height? What’s my weight? You should see the guesses out\nthere. Some people have me at 5’6”, some guys have got me at 226lbs. I can tell you this: I’m neither of those.\nBut more importantly, whether or not you know my stats is not important to me. What is important\nis that there’s a value in this. There’s a big teaching point that we can\nmake, that I think will become extremely valuable for you. Especially as you set your own goals.\nSo, we’re going to knock this out. By the way, we already did this in the “Gummy Bear\nChallenge” video. I showed my stats back then, despite the fact\nthat all these numbers were out there. By the way, do you remember losing that challenge,\nJesse? JESSE: Yeah, I do. Thanks for bringing it\nup. JEFF: Remember the- JESSE: The beard. JEFF: Yeah. JESSE: It’s gone. JEFF: Yeah. It’s gone. It’s gone. So,\nthe shoes are off, guys. By the way, ATHLEANX socks – not available for purchase yet on\nthe website. We’re going to get our height. By the way, Jesse; is this safe for me to\nget under this? JESSE: Uh…I think so. JEFF: You literally taped a tape measure up\non the wall. JESSE: Well, ti’s the best I could do. JEFF: Okay. All right. So take this straight\nedge and get out of here before this thing falls on me. Head back up. Is that good? JESSE: Okay. Yep. And move. Okay, you are\nat 5’10- ½”. Look at you. JEFF: I’ll take the half, thank you very\nmuch. Now, guys, you’ve got to get bodyweight. This fluctuates a bit for me. JESSE: Lowest, it looks like you’re on 175. JEFF: Okay. So, 175. We’ll take off 2lbs\nfor the clothes. So, 173’ish. Now, some of you have already made a big mistake and\nI’ve caught you. I caught you. You’re saying “Wait, 5’10- ½”, 173?\nThat’s me! I’m 5’10- ½”, 173! But I don’t look like Jeff!” Well, that’s\nbecause if you just rely on height and weight you’ve obviously missed the biggest, most\nimportant criteria here. That is, when it comes to qualifying any height\nor weight you need to know the bodyfat because it’s going to allow you to paint a much\nclearer picture. Somebody could be 5’10”, 175lbs and be\n30% body fat and look completely different than someone at 10% bodyfat. And we know that.\nSo, we’re going to do the bodyfat. I have the Skyndex here, set for my age. Don’t\nmake fun, Jesse. JESSE: [laughs] You’re old! JEFF: So, what we do is, we go up here on\nthe chest. I’ll do my own pinching. I used to do this for every member of the team on\nthe Mets. Okay, then you get the abdomen here. Pull away. Then we get the thigh. Jesse, keep\nyour eyes up. JESSE: Oh. Well, then how am I supposed to\nfilm this? JEFF: Okay. It comes in at 5.8%. So, I’ve\nstayed pretty much 5.8% all year round. You guys are probably going to make the second\nmistake. The second mistake is: “Wait a second. How in the world could I be 5.8%? How does he walk around with 5.8% bodyfat\nyear-round? That’s ridiculous! Who does that?” Guys, I can tell you this: it’s\nnot without sacrifice. It’s not without consistency. It’s not without commitment. But it’s also not without a prioritization\non that. This is important to me. Being lean is one of the main things that’s important\nto me. It’s part of our brand name: ATHLEANX. However, also being athletic and moving a\ncertain way. And of course, being strong. I could tell\nyou this, guys, I know this, if anybody knows this. If you do three things, I don’t care\nwhat body type you’re sitting in right now, you’re going to look better. If you put on more muscle, if you get leaner,\nand you get stronger; you’re going to look better. Period. There’s not a person out\nthere that couldn’t benefit from that. But what this also underscores is the value of\nleanness. When you are lean, whatever amount of muscle\nmass you carry looks bigger. It looks better. That’s probably where the 220lb guess came\nfrom, because I can’t imagine anyone that stood next to me would think that. At the same time, guys, I think you become\na bit more athletic when you carry less excess bodyfat. Weight slowing you down is not helping\nyou become more athletic. So, I think prioritizing those things, letting\nmy leanness help and assist my athleticism has been one of my main goals. But it doesn’t\nmean that I don’t want to be strong at the same time. For the reason I just mentioned. There’s a value to all three of those. As\na matter of fact, you guys know that I like the weighted chin-up. I’m working toward\nmy three-plate weighted chin-up and doing more, and more reps here. Jesse came by and he’s like “Wait a second,\nI actually filmed you” – he wanted me to show you this clip of him doing a one-plate\nweighted chin-up. I’m proud of what he’s doing here. But he was discouraged because all of a sudden,\nhe was comparing himself to me. I think that’s where the danger comes in here, guys. You\ndon’t need to compare yourself to others. Especially when it comes to body stats because\nof the fact that you need to understand that it’s not just body stats that should inspire\nyou. There is so much more that can come from looking beyond just body stats. Let me explain\na little bit. When I was a kid the physique role models\nI had – very well know, by this point – Sylvester Stallone. That’s the guy that I wanted to\nbe. I wanted to look like he did in Rambo. Some might say, “Jeff, you’ve actually\nbecome [to look] a bit like Sylvester Stallone in Rambo.” That’s cool for me, but I always wanted\nto still maintain athleticism at the same time. Which has been a key focus of mine.\nBut if I had also wanted to aspire to be Arnold Schwarzenegger – who is another huge icon\nof that time – I could have been making a big mistake. Why? Because Arnold is 6’3”, 240lbs. Present\nday: The Rock. He’s 6’3”, 250lbs-260lbs. I watched wrestling all the time. Hulk Hogan.\nRick Rude. Guys that stand here, next to me, in my own gym – recently, Seamus came in\nhere with Cesaro. Jinder Mahal has been here. Drew McIntyre.\nWith Florin Munteanu with Creed. Guys that I train, guys that come through here; these\nare big guys. I don’t get self-conscious standing next to those guys. Do you know why? Because I’ve come to grips\nwith the fact that I’m not going to be them, physically, in terms of their stature. That’s\nnot in the cards for me. If you look at the skeleton here, guys, those guys’ skeletons,\nI assure you, do not look like this underneath their bodies. This guy looks a bit more like me. The fact\nis, we have certain clavicles that are a certain length, that can carry a certain amount of\npec musculature here. If your clavicle comes out to here, if you have much wider shoulders\nbecause you’re a much bigger guy; you have a much bigger skeleton inside you. You have to fill that skeleton with more muscle\nmass. Therefore, that muscle mass carries more water, which is going to allow you weigh\nmore, too. These are things that aren’t necessarily in the cards for me. But that’s\nwhen you only measure stats. The same way when we make the mistake of isolating\nthat for our inspiration, we’ve just cut ourselves short. If I wanted to look like\na guy like Thor Bjornsson, who’s deadlifted 1000lbs; I wouldn’t ever have the opportunity\nto say “Man, I’ve got some work to do.” Now, I realize that I’m not going to prioritize\nstrength as the only thing I work toward, so I’m never going to have 1000lbs deadlift.\nBut that doesn’t mean I can’t have a stronger deadlift. Drawing some inspiration from him\nis a great thing. Let’s go back to The Rock for a second. Who, in this world, cannot benefit from aspiring\nto match his work ethic? I don’t care what you want to say. “Oh, well The Rock uses\nstuff.” Forget that. That’s all nonsense. That’s all BS because it’s irrelevant\nwhen it comes to his work ethic. There’s nobody right now that works harder\nat what he does and works harder in the weight room than him. So, if you don’t think you\ncould benefit from that, I think you’re doing yourself a disservice. The same thing\nwith all the rest of those that come through here. If you understood the travel schedule they\nhave. But their desire and commitment to stay in their training regimens despite being in\na different city every night or carrying their nutrition with them to make sure they have\nproper food from city to city, knowing they don’t know what food is available to them;\nthat’s dedication. You could benefit from any of that. If you\ngo back to me, “Well, Jeff, you couldn’t be that lean.” Guys, again, I’ve prioritized\nit. So, what I make are sacrifices. I have that much noted one carrot cake, one cheat\nmeal a year. I don’t drink. When I go out with my friends I don’t drink. That makes it much easier to stay lean. I’ve\nalso been doing this consistently now for years, and years, and years. I’ve made it\nmy life’s focus. Not to just be lean, but to be overall well-rounded. So, if you define you, if you make sure what\nyou feel is important, you aspire to; that’s what matters most. Don’t limit it to just\nbody stats because body stats could be greatly deceiving. Guys, I hope you’ve found this\nhelpful. Above all, truthfully, maybe we can finally\nclear the air on what I actually weigh, and what my height is. The fact is, guys, I want\nyou guys to be the best you can be. If you’re looking for programs that we have,\nthat allow you to become the best you can be – from total body training programs,\nwe’ve got a brand new one, Total Beast, available over at ATHLEANX.com. To any of our any other programs focused directly\non athleticism, we have programs that match your goals. You just have to find what those\ngoals are for you. They’re all available over there.
