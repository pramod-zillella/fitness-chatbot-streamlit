    "transcript": "And so even though I love Arnold, the \nBench Fly still gets the big red X.   What's up, guys, Jeff Cavaliere, athleanx.com. \nSo, what you see behind me is a bunch of different   chest exercises likely that you recognize because \nyou re wither doing them right now, or you ve done   them in the past. However, today I'm going to \nrank them from the worst to the best so you can   be sure that you're only focusing on the ones that \ngive you the gains that you're after. So, by the   time this video is over, you're going to want to \nkeep some of these and others that you're going to   want to kind of just throw away. So that being \nsaid, let's start ranking them one by one.\n  All right, so as we work our way from the bottom \nup, it's important to point out that the exercises   are placed into these categories for a reason. \nThere are some criteria that goes into selecting   where an exercise will fall. For instance, we \nwant to make sure this is an exercise that can   actually deliver results. But we don't want it \nto be something that is insufficient and being   able to challenge you into cause growth. We also \nwant to select exercises or favor those that are   multidimensional. They are good for building \nmuscle, but they're also capable of delivering   good strength gains. We're going to favor \nthose. We also have some exercises that are just   downright dumb. We'll get to those too, and then \nwe have the exercises that kind of invite injury   risk. And that's something we want to avoid, \nespecially if we have better, safer options. \n  And that's why we start at the bottom of the \nlist right here with the Bench Fly. Now, look,   I understand that Arnold loved this exercise, but \njust because he loved the Fly and I love Arnold   doesn't mean that I have to love the Fly. \nNot because I want to dislike the exercise,   but more so that my physical therapy background \ntells me that there's reasons to dislike it.   When you perform it on a bench in this unsupported \nway with no safety net, you increase the risk of   damage to the anterior shoulder capsule. \nThat is something that you don't want to damage   ever, because it's very hard to repair and \nrestore normal mechanics after that happens.   Not to mention increased risk of pec tear that \nhappens because of the extreme positioning of   your arms during this exercise. Again, all of \nthis negated most of all by the fact that there   are better alternatives to this that I will cover \nfor you later on down this list. The fact is, for   all these reasons, guys, I have to put the big red \nX first and foremost through the Bench Fly. \n  All right. So next up in the category of worst is \none that might actually come as a surprise to you,   because you know how often I like to train on my \nfeet, if at all possible. But it's the Standing   Cable Press. The issue with the Standing Cable \nPress is it provides more of a challenge to your   core than the muscles you re actually trying to \nbuild. And just getting into this position here   with any type of heavy weight is going to make \nmy abs work much harder to make sure that I don't   fall backwards when I'm doing the movement. And \neven if I do this out of a split stance where I'm   leaning, my weight forward is still not optimal if \nI'm going to press the weight that's necessary to   cause that overload and growth that we're looking \nfor. For all these reasons, guys the Standing   Cable Press is just not the best press to do \nwhen you're looking for gains in your chest. \n  So, a couple of big red Xs on the board behind \nme. We're still not out of the worst category yet.   Here we have to throw in the Incline Bench Press. \nNow, wait, before you riot, understand that just   like size matters, angle matters too--a lot. \nAnd when it comes to the Incline Bench Press   what angle are you setting it at, because it \nreally matters in terms of the gains that you   see from the exercise, especially up here in \nthe upper chest. We know that the front delt   and the upper chest fiber's share not only a \nclose proximity to each other anatomically,   but they share some function too.\nWell, we know that if we were to get   completely upright, we would shift the majority \nof that function to the front delt, as we would   in an Overhead Press. And if we got completely \nhorizontal, most of the work would be done   by the chest. Well, that being said, we have to \nfind that happy medium. And once you cross 50,   55 or 60 degrees, you're actually starting to go \ninto that realm of less work for the chest and   more for the front delts which is not why you're \ndoing the exercise in the first place. If you   want to maximize your gains on the Incline Bench \nPress, we're going to choose a lower angle, we'll   cover that one later. But for now, the 60-degree \nIncline Bench Press has to get the big red X. \n  No time hasn't made it any better, \nit's still fucking stupid. \n  So, now those gladly behind us I get to break out \nmy blue marker as we work our way up the rankings   into the Better Category. I say better, not best, \nbecause there's still some limitations here that   I think it's important for you to be aware of. \nAnd we have to start right here with the king of   all of the better exercises, it s the Pushup. \nAnd I say the basic pushup because the basic   pushup is oftentimes, as I pointed out in our \nmajor criteria in the beginning of this video,   not challenging enough.\nIt's just simply not driving   enough of a stimulus to cause change in the size \nof your chest because you can do too many of them.   If you're ripping off 30, 40 or 50 repetitions \nper set, there are variations that are going to   provide a better challenge in the basic pushup \nno longer is it. Now, if you're a beginner who's   still getting challenged by this exercise, then \nby all means you continue to build your strength   up with it before you move on. But that being \nsaid, guys, most of us are beyond the point   now where this is where we should be focusing \nour efforts. So, for that reason, I got to give   it a Better listing, but not Best yet because \nwe know there's better variations to come. \n  So, since Betters are all about improvement, \nlet's go back to those flys again, because I   wouldn't leave you hanging, I wanted to give you \nan improved version of it or a safer version of   it. And for that, we have to look at the Floor \nFly. I'm a much bigger fan of this exercise   because it gives us a chance to have resisted \nadduction, but we get a chance to do it in a   safer setting with the floor acting as the safety \nnet protecting that anterior shoulder because we   don't have those extreme ranges of motion at the \nbottom. Now, some would argue you don't get the   same amount of stretch, but I don't even know \nif that's the real benefit of the Fly anyway.\n  Beyond that, we do get to increase \nthe weight that we use on a Floor Fly   versus the weight that we can handle to ensure \nthat safety on a Bench Fly. And for that, we can   create more overload with this in an eccentric \nmanner, which is going to give us an opportunity   for more growth. For all these reasons, the Better \nversion of the fly is definitely the Floor Fly.\n  And wrapping up our better category here is \nan often-overlooked exercise that I believe   deserves a second look, and it's the Underhand \nDumbbell Bench Press. And the best thing about   this exercise is it provides those that don't have \naccess to an incline bench to still work their   upper chest, especially better than that 60-degree \nincline dumbbell bench press. EMG studies have   actually shown superior activation of those chest \nfibers during the underhand version rather than   too high of an incline press. That being said, \nit doesn't come without its limitations. \n  Namely the fact that you're not going to be able \nto load this exercise as much and that's mostly   due to the fact that there's a lack of stability \nat the bottom for some. You have to have enough   shoulder external rotation to be able to get your \nbody in the right position with your elbows tucked   at your sides and your hands, elbows in line to \nsupport the dumbbells, to be able to drive them   up and that low to high dumbbell path to get that \ngood upper chest activation. And if you don't have   that or you're simply looking to load the exercise \nas heavy as possible, then this one might not be   the one for you. But it still deserves its Better \nrecognition and that's why we're going to put it   right here at the end of the Better category.\nAnd now we continue our way up the chart from the   worst to the best chest exercises. And we land \nhere squarely in the Even Better Still category,   meaning better than what we just did, but not \nquite in the best yet. But I have to start here   with that variation of the pushup that I promised \nyou before. This is called the Twisting Pushup.   And the main thing we're getting here is this \nadditional relative adduction that small but   incredibly important addition to the basic pushup \nthat will take whatever repetition you can do of   the basic pushup and bring it dramatically \ndownwards. But at the same time increase   the effectiveness of it and that's really all \nthat matters. No matter what count you can do   of your regular pushup right now, I promise \nyou, less pushups here, but more from it. For   that reason, we give the Twisting Pushup the \nfirst in the Even Better Still Category.\n  And speaking of adduction, our next exercise \nand are Even Better Still Category is one that   focuses on that adduction function of the chest \nbetter than the things we showed you already,   including even the Floor Fly and it s the Cable \nCrossover. So, the thing about the Cable Crossover   is that it not only gives us a chance to get \nmore production because you're getting our hands   slightly across midline, but it also gives us the \nchance to have peak tension. We tend to lose it in   either version of the dumbbell fly floor or bench. \nBut the limitation here comes in the same thing   that we dealt with the Standing Cable Press. \nI believe the Cable Crossover is an exercise that   we can load up much heavier than we traditionally \ndo. But as we do, we can see we have the same   stability demands and the demands placed on \nthe core to keep us in this upright position   that might limit the amount of weight that we can \nuse. If we limit the amount of weight we limit,   the amount of overload, and by limiting \nthe amount of overload, we limit the amount   of growth. For that reason, guys, the Cable \nCrossover is my induction exercise of choice,   at least for now when we're talking about the \nBetter Still exercises. More on that to come. \n  Next up, the Better Still Category is another \nvariation of a bench press, it s actually one of   my favorites when your goal is mostly hypertrophy \nand a little bit less than a focus on strength.   It s the Lying Cable Bench Press. \nAnd what this does is it provides   you with a better strength curve, with more \nresistance throughout the entire strength curve   on the bench press because of the use of \nthe cables. If I set the cables out wide,   the line of resistance is the cable itself. So, \nyou can see that it maintains its perpendicularity   throughout a greater range of motion than, \nlet's say, on a typical bench press. So,   at the top of the exercise, when I've reached my \npeak contraction in my chest, I actually still   have a lot of tension here that I wouldn't \nhave with a typical barbell or dumbbell. \n  That being said, the difficulty still lies in \nthe fact that I have to get this into position   to do a heavy weight. But again, when it \ncomes to placing tension on the chest,   this is one of the best. I'm going to place \nit here in this category for that reason. \n  And concluded or Better Still Category is one of \nthose chest exercises that people sometimes don't   even realize works the chest and it's the Dumbbell \nUpper Chest Pullover. And I'm careful to add the   designation of upper chest to make sure people \nunderstand that there's a way to perform this   to favor the upper chest rather than the \nlats. We know the typical dumbbell pull   over works the last because we're driving it \nwith our elbows in this flare position.\n  However, if you do the opposite of that, you \nbring your elbows as tight together as possible.   You can quickly shift the focus to the upper chest \nbecause it's got all the components of a great   upper chest contraction. Our arms are elevated up \nover our head, remembering that we go from this   low to high position to get those upper chest \nfibrous activated. And we have the squeezing,   the abduction of the elbows as close together \nthat really lights us up. Throw a dumbbell on   our hand. We get the overload we're looking \nfor and that's the reason why I don't want   you to overlook this exercise any longer. \nAnd so, some tough contenders left on the board.   We move into our Almost Best Category, and I get \nto break out my green marker and we start right   here with the Dip. And for me, the dip is the best \nversion of a pushup. If you think about it, the   dip is essentially a suspended pushup, especially \nif you angle your body more forward to favor the   chest rather than staying upright in favor of \nyour triceps. That being said, the opportunity   here to load this exercise is going to be much \neasier than we have in a pushup. I could strap   a weight around my waist and do a weighted dip and \ncontinue to provide the progressive overload.\n  We need to drive both the strength and the \nsize gains that this exercise provides.   Not to mention I could do a couple of other \nunique things, like adding a small twist,   which would be similar to the twisting pushup \nto get just that little bit of extra adduction,   which will bring that rep count down for the \neffectiveness of the exercise up. For all these   reasons, the dip is going to get my first in the \nAlmost Best Category, and it belongs there. \n  So, if you haven't caught on by now, you know \nthat I like adduction and we want to try to   get into the chest exercises we perform if we \nwant to see the best gains from it. And that's   why I got to go back to it once again with my best \noption here and this is the Heavy 1-Arm Crossover.   And how is this different from the crossover? \nWell, in a very important way. Number one,   much more stability. Instead of having to move \nboth arms at one time, which let's say you have   80 pounds in each hand, you're not going to \nbe able to stabilize the total 160 as well   as you can't the 80 one arm at a time. Which is \ngoing to eliminate those balance limitations and   allow your core to take a back seat to the \nmuscle you're actually trying to build. \n  And what I like to do here, as I mentioned, is go \nheavy because you have the opportunity to do that.   Stop doing this exercise as a 30 rep burn out \nat the end of your chest workout. Instead,   prioritize it as one of those great ways \nto get adduction. Not just adduction,   but full adduction across midline better than in \nany other exercise we performed so far. This is   going to be my adduction exercise of choice for \nthose reasons, it is going to belong firmly up   here at the top and my Almost Best Category.\nAnd concluding now our Almost Best Category and   giving those that are still hyperventilating \nafter looking at the thumbnail a reason to   breathe easy. We have the Incline Bench \nPress up here at the top. The reason, though,   is we're putting it at that 30-to-45-degree angle, \nnot the steeper angle that we talked about before,   Because as I said, the angle matters. It's been \nfound that the perfect angle to engage the upper   chest without over activating the front delts \nis going to be this 30-to-45-degree angle. Now,   whether or not your bench goes to the \nspecific degree doesn't really matter.   Just try to go on the shallower side versus \nsteeper, when the upper chest fibers you're   looking to really engage is the chest that you're \ntrying to grow rather than your shoulders. This   is my choice right here firmly at the top. \nAnd so, then with any list ranking, the best chest   exercises from worst to first, there can only be \none first. There can only be one best and it s   the one that s been staring at you the whole \ntime, right here dead smack in the middle,   The Barbell or the Dumbbell Bench Press. And I'm \ngiving you the option. Why? Because I just want to   make sure that you're doing one of them. And the \nreason why we put this at the top of this list   is because it gives us the best opportunity to do \nthe one thing that we know can continue to drive   both strength and hypertrophy and that is overload \nhis movement. The Barbell or the Dumbbell Bench,   it's something you can easily continue to \nup the weight on, which is going to continue   to progressively keep those gains coming. \nNow, look, the choice between the two exercises is   going to be up to you. Some may find the dumbbells \nare going to give you a little bit more adduction   at the top because you can move your hands closer \ntowards each other. And others are going to find   that's a little bit easier on the shoulders to do \nthe dumbbells versus the barbells. Others who are   looking to just prioritize strength are likely \ngoing to choose the barbell variation because it   gives you that extra 20% bump in your total. The \nfact is this gets the top spot when we re looking   at the best chest exercises for strength, size \nand growth of your chest. Or wait, maybe not.  \n  And so, since the goal of this video is to \ngive you the best possible information I   could. You're going to have to allow you to \nbend the rules just a little bit. You see,   because the best chess exercise is actually not \nchess exercise at all. It's a combination of   exercises from the Bench Press down into that \nHeavy 1-Arm Crossover. Realizing that you're   going to get that all important adduction, the \nonly missing element from the back bench press   to create the perfect complement and take the best \nexercise and make it the greatest of all time. \n  And so with that, guys, hopefully you now know \nwhich of the chess exercises you should be doing   and which of the chess exercises maybe you want \nto ditch. The key is understanding why we pick   what we pick, because the size of the selection \nmatters. As always, we put the science into all   we do here.
