    "transcript": "What s up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, Athleanx.com. Even if you don't go to the gym, we all at\nleast likely hit the ground at some point to bang out some crunches. It's one of the most popular ab exercises\nwe do again. Even if you're not committed to the gym, you've\nlikely done them. But what if I told you is also one of the\nmost commonly performed exercises. Today, I wanted to put a video together to\nshowcase the 10 most common errors to make sure that you don't make them anymore. So that being said, let's jump right into\nthe first one. Mistake number one might actually come as\na surprise to some of you because you might already be on the crunches suck bandwagon. That being said, I'm not, and there's good\nreason for it. You see, lumbar flexion is one of the main\nfunctions of the abdominal muscles, and we can do it safely. Now, look, I appreciate the researchers that\nhave gone into great depth to show that they don't believe that crunches are the best thing\nyou could do for your body. However, I don't necessarily agree with the\nresearch itself. And we know that a lot of times when the research\nis being done, it's being done not on humans, but on animals. But more importantly, we're looking at cadavers\noftentimes, which are dried out and aren't responding the same way that a living, breathing\nhuman being is, at least in terms of how their spine moves during a crunch. Throw in the fact that the accumulation of\nloading is oftentimes never represented in a way that we do it when we do crunches, and\nthat is, we actually take a break and we decompress from time to time, which saves our spine knowing\nthat we can regenerate. The bottom line here is, guys, it's too early\nto jump on the crunches suck bandwagon, particularly when we know that there's benefits to be had. However, you do need to do it in the right\nway, which is why we proceed to number two. Now, I'll admit people that say that crunches\naren't good oftentimes are complaining about low back pain after doing them. But that's oftentimes because they're hooking\ntheir feet the wrong way. You see, if you put your feet under something\nto stabilize your body and pull up, all you're doing is over activating your hip flexors,\nwhich can actually go and create low back pain because of their attachment on the lumbar\nspine. However, we can make the simple adjustment\nof putting your feet over the top of something to anchor your body. This gets you that all important activation\nof the hamstrings, letting the hip flexors relax and taking that excess strain off of\nyour lower back. It's a simple switch, but it's a big one when\nit comes to leaving you with only the gains and none of the pains that you get from crunches. Speaking of pains, let's talk about a pain\nin the neck now. No, no, no. Jesse's not in this video. That's not cool. We're talking about what happens when you\npull on your neck, when you do crunches. Now there's one thing I've seen more than\nanything else is this in the gym all the time, people hook their hands behind their head\nand they pull on their neck first, acting as if they could just lift their eyes up higher\nthat the view will look like they actually went a long way. You're focusing on the wrong point here, guys. You've got to focus on your shoulder blades. You want to make sure that you're clearing\nthe bottom of your shoulder blades off of the ground on every repetition. Then and only then have you completed one\nrep and going beyond is actually something you don't want to do either. And you see, that's because most of us worry\nabout the wrong thing when people sole focus is getting to a fully seated position. They don't necessarily worry about how they\ngot there. And I say all the time, getting from point\nA to point B isn't the important point, it's the journey that got you there and the quality\nof what got you there. Now, there's nothing wrong with a fully executed\nset up, if done properly. But I'm saying when people are doing their\ncrunches, they should stop focusing on their height that they get and focus more on the\nquality of the contraction. It doesn't matter if you slow down your pace. The key is that you want to make sure that\nyour abs are initiating the contraction and controlling it all the way up. And oh yeah, all the way down too. The eccentric lowering on a crunch is just\nas important as the way up, but both of them matter. And it only is going to happen right if you're\nfocusing on the contraction of the abs alone and not just how high or how low you're getting. This next one can be confusing for a lot of\npeople, but you have to make sure you get this right. If you want your abs to look the best from\nthe crunches that you're doing. You'll be building up that bulging belly,\neven if it has a six pack over the top, rather than that flat type belly that you're looking\nfor. And when we're talking about here is how you\nbreathe during the exercise. Now we all have been told that you want to\nbreathe out on the exertion of an exercise, but it doesn't mean you want to push out while\nyou're doing a crunch. What I mean is you don't want to descend your\nbelly and push out as you're coming up into a crunch. As a matter of fact, you want to try to be\nable to gain the skill to be able to pull down or cinch the stomach down as you breathe\nout. And the way to do this with some good feedback\nis to just play something like a tennis ball or an object on your belly and focus on first\npulling your belly down, contracting the transverse abdominis and then initiating the crunch and\nnot allowing that belly of yours to push out and have that object fall off. Again, there's a nuance here and what we're\ntalking about, but descending and pushing out is not the same as breathing out. You want to make sure that you can breathe\nout while pulling in to get the right breathing pattern and ultimately the esthetics you're\nlooking for when you're trying to carve out your six pack. If the obsession with elevation off the ground\nwas one problem, this is problem number two and it s just as bad. And it's those that like to stay on the ground\nand come up maybe two or three inches and simply pump away. Look, I know who you are. When you're doing this, you're not even really\nworried about the quality, once again, you're only worried about the numbers. And I say it all the time stop counting reps\nand instead make your reps count. When it comes to crunches guys, you want to\nmake sure that every single rep is executed properly. And the only way you're going to do that is\nby forgetting about how high you can count to and instead of focusing on how much you\ncan make hurt in those muscles on every single rep you do. Mistake number seven actually relates to what\nyou're seeing when you do your crunches. And when I'm talking about is change your\nview every once in a while, don't always do them face up. We want to do is make sure you do your crunches\nin other positions. You see, people oftentimes overlook the fact\nthat crunches are crunches, whether or not you're lying face up or in this case, face\ndown. You see, lumbar flexion is the main driver\nof abdominal activation through a crunch, and we can do that so many other ways. As a matter of fact, I've shown you many ways\non this channel to do just that and actually do it in a closed chain manner. Which for me is always a better way to do\nthe exercise because it gives you a more seamless flow through the kinetic chain to allow these\nground reaction forces to pass up and down through our entire body, most of all, transmitting\nright through the core. If you remember one thing from this video,\nmake sure you're mixing it up because if you always do the same thing, you're going to\nkeep getting the same thing you've always gotten. Now that being said, I have my issues with\ncertain crunches done in an alternative position. This is the crunch pull down, and this is\nnot the way you do it. You see, a lot of times people do this exercise\nand instead of focus on, once again, lumbar flexion, they focus on hip flexion. Simply sitting back onto their heels and letting\nthat do all the work for them. If you want this exercise to work for you,\nyou have to learn how to keep your butt in the right position, meaning the same position\nyou started in. From here, you just want to simply pull your\nelbows down towards the ground using just the flexion of your lumbar spine and not the\nsitting back of your pelvis onto your heels. Guys, remember how you do what you do is always\ngoing to matter almost always more than what you do, so focus on how you do it, especially\nthis exercise. But now let's mix how you do and what you\ndo together. And this is an exercise that a lot of times\nwe don't remember to do in our crunch repertoire, and it's the side crunch. But as always, how you do it matters once\nagain. This exercise is one again that you shouldn't\nbe pulling on your neck, but more importantly, you should be focusing on that really high-quality\ncontraction. I think it's one of the most important exercises\nthat I have in my arsenal and the one most responsible for the oblique development that\nI have because I do this with severe intent. Every single time I lift off of the ground. Again, I'm not yanking on my neck, I'm focusing\non getting my elbow closer to my hip, but initiating through and only through the oblique\nmuscles on my side. Again, I can even tilt this or turn this a\nlittle bit to engage some of the rectus, but it's only done when I have a real focus intention\non the muscles I'm trying to contract. Try to put your mind right where that muscle\nis and think about it as if you're the muscle itself going through that contraction and\nI promise you, you're going to get way more out of this exercise, and the development\nthat you'll see here will be much quicker because you're doing it the right way. And that brings me to mistake number 10 and\nthat is, you're only doing crunches. You see, I like crunches, and again, they're\npart of an important ab training program. However, if you're only doing crunches, even\nif you're doing them from alternative positions, you're not training your abs fully. I talk about all the time, guys. The functions of the abs are many. In some cases, their job is to prevent you\nfrom moving at all, preventing extension, preventing rotation, preventing side bending. You want to make sure that you're doing exercises\nthat do all of these things. As a matter of fact, guys, I build that into\nevery single one of our ab workouts that we include with our athletics programs you can\nfind over at Athleanx.com. We have an ab shuffle generator that will\ncreate a perfect ab workout for you every single time based on the equipment that you\nhave. It's included again with all of our programs.
