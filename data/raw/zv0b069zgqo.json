    "transcript": "What's up, guys? Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com. Today we’re going to talk all about beginners\nand that means – welcome, Jesse. JESSE: You took me out of hiding? JEFF: Well, now you’ve got a Seamus shirt\non, so… JESSE: The things I do for you here. JEFF: Way to bust right back into the ATHLEANX\nvideo. I love Seamus. Seamus, he’s rocking your shirt. Today we’re talking about the six biggest\nmistakes that beginners make. I think it’s very, very common. I think there are mistakes that a lot of us\nmake, or I wouldn’t be covering them in this video. I do think we all continue to learn. So, though you may not think of yourself as\na beginner, there’s always something you can learn. We’ve got guys who have been training for\n50 years who watch this channel, who I hope are saying “Gosh, I learned something new\ntoday”, or even in this video I hope, too. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: With that being said, let’s knock\nthem out one by one. The biggest mistakes that beginners make that\nwe can now start to change. You learn a lot of things by training with\nfull range of motion. I’m talking about on your big, compound\nlifts. Your basic lifts. We’ll get into that in a second, too. The necessity of those. But you actually learn how to become more\ncoordinated. You weren’t the most coordinated person\nthe first time you came into the gym. JESSE: No. Even as an athlete. JEFF: I was going to say, the fact is, you\ncan go out and play your sport and be pretty decent at it in the process but get in the\nweight room and it’s a new skill. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: So, you get on the bench-press bar and\nthe bar starts going like this. Or, God forbid, you grab a couple of dumbbells\nand the dumbbells start wavering. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: I saw it, right? It’s not pretty, but we all do it. I did it myself as well. One of the things that happens by training\nthrough full range of motion is, you learn how to integrate multiples muscle groups. The ones that are all responsible for performing\nthose compound lifts, to get them to execute the movement properly. You do that through more and more strength\nas you build it up, and coordination. So, full range of motion is great for that. Now, let’s say you have an injury. I’m a proponent for using abbreviated range\nof motions sometimes to get around, and train around an injury without having to forego\ntraining entirely. JESSE: Right. JEFF: But if you’re a beginner, you shouldn’t\nbe injured yet. I stress that. That’s one of the main things I’m going\nto cover here, as we build down through this video. Beginners should be looking to fortify their\nbodies and build a really strong base that is also fortified against injury. You don’t want to ignore the big lifts. I’ve talked about this concept before called\n‘exerphobia’. Specific exercises can sometimes generate\nmore fear – especially for a beginner – than others. Let’s talk about some of them. The squat. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: The deadlift. JESSE: Mm-hmm. JEFF: The bench-press. JESSE: Yep. JEFF: Why? JESSE: Because, when you go to the gym you\nexpect to be – you expect to have a ton of plates on there and you think everyone\nwill be looking at you like “Oh, that kid’s benching 95?” JEFF: That’s a reality into being self-conscious. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: But I can tell you, from a physiological\nstandpoint, you’ve got the most weight on the bar during those exercises. Which is why we need to do them, because they\nbuild that foundation. I’ve stressed it here many, many times before. The foundation of your strength training and\nbuilding should be around those exercises because they’re compound movements, they\nutilize multiple joints, multiple muscle groups that are all contributing to the overall strength\nof the lift. Meaning, they have the highest capacity for\nbeing loaded. JESSE: Mm-hmm. JEFF: So that’s great, but through your\nfear – and some of the guys that are watching this – I know the reality of it, guys. Even when I was in college I used to have\na fear of going to the weight room and attacking any of the big, compound lifts because the\nguys around me were using a lot more weight than I was. You don’t want to look substandard, or you\ndon’t want to look insufficient when it comes to those lifts. So, a lot of times you might think “Oh,\nthis guy’s skipping them altogether.” That’s a big, big, big mistake. What you want to do is make sure you’re\ndoing those exercises, and you load them up properly with weight than you can handle. That leads us to error number three. Using weights that you cannot command. Have you done that? JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: Really? Yeah, I’ve seen him do it. Using weights that you cannot command. The issue with this is, it’s not about – it’s\nnot a race for a certain number, guys. I know we have strength standards and people\nlike to apply them, but it’s not a race to achieve a certain number at the expense\nof building foundational strength, and what I call ‘true strength’. You can compensate your ass all the way to\nthe end of the day where you build up a number, but you’re compensating in doing so. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: And I can tell you this, when this kid\ncame to me – can we recreate at least a little bit of what you looked like, posturally,\nwhen you came to me? That’s not even half as bad as what it actually\nwas. Jesse was kind of a mess, right? JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: He was a mess. Putting him under the bar in that condition\nis an irresponsible coach. You wouldn’t do that to someone like that\nbecause his skeletal frame couldn’t even handle the weight that I was trying to apply\nto his body. And it could be a low-level weight. What he had to do, first and foremost, was\nlearn how to retrain his body to be better equipped to handle anything, let alone excessive\nweights. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: So, what you have to do is build that\nbase. We spent some time on trying to correct you. And again, it’s worked for you. You have made a dramatic change, in terms\nof how your posture is. JESSE: I’d like to think so. JEFF: You have. You’ve added some significant muscle on\ntop of that, too. But if I had let you jump in, and just start\npiling weights on top of that, while I may see those numbers go up, and you might see\nthose numbers go up yourself; realize that it’s going to come back and bite you. Every, single time it’s going to come back\nand bite you because you built up a whole hell of a lot of this compensation, and compensatory\nstrength along the way that would be lying about where your true strength is. So, utilize the weights that you can command\nand take away some of that fear, in terms of attacking those big lifts because you know\nthey’re necessary. Now, we’ve also covered this topic. This is the fourth big mistake. That is relying solely on the big lifts. You cannot rely solely on the big lifts for\nmany, many, many, many, many reasons, guys. As someone that trains athletes and actually\nis out there training athletes I’ll tell you this: relying solely on the big lifts\nat the expense of worrying about some of these other things, like we’ve talked about with\nposture. But beyond that, on multiple planes- JESSE: Yeah. J: The big lifts themselves – the bench-press,\nthe squat, and the deadlift – are simply sagittal plane movements. If you want to be effective as a human being\n– not just an athlete – you’d better be able to learn how to move in the frontal\nplane – which is side to side – and move in the transverse plane, too. We do that all the time. For you, as an athlete, of course it’s incredibly,\nincredibly important to do that. JESSE: Yeah. On the lacrosse field I’m not in one spot. I’m moving side to side, forward and back,\nand pivoting all the time. JEFF: And allowing ourselves to incorporate\naccessory lifts. Just as Casey Mitchell was in here and told\nus how the bulk of his training relied on hitting the accessory lifts multiple times\nthroughout the week, and then hitting his big, compound lifts at a lesser frequency\nthan the accessories. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: We do the same thing as well, guys. You incorporate your accessory lifts and train\nin these different planes. The thing about it is, let’s say we’re\ntalking about training legs and you incorporate lunging. Just because you’re sometimes moving in\nthe sagittal plane on a lunge, if you’re offset loading with one dumbbell with one\nside, you’re actually training the frontal plane. So, there are ways than you can incorporate\ntraining in multiple planes that still have you moving in the sagittal plane. You have to have an understanding of this. I think it’s a great opportunity for someone,\nas a beginner, to expand their knowledge. Learn as much as you can about training, so\nyou can become more effective and more diverse when you do hit the weight room. JESSE: Right. JEFF: It gives you an opportunity and appreciation\nfor these things. I call this “lazy training”. A lot of times, as beginners, we lazily attack\nthe exercises in the workouts we do. I covered this in a video with you before. JESSE: Yeah. J: About your approach to the Bulgarian split\nsquat with the single leg, right? JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: The plyo. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: Jesse was kind of coasting through that\nand with just a little bit of attention and cues toward it, all of a sudden, he was putting\nmuch more effort into the exercises, applying much more effort. His jumps were incredibly explosive. Something that is good for Jesse, with him\nas an athlete. But the fact is, if you’re not prompted\nto do so, beginners will often times just lazily hit their exercises. They don’t attack their exercises. They don’t squeeze the bar. When is the last time, as a beginner, when\nyou grabbed a set of dumbbells, or you grabbed a bar at a bench-press, you actually squeezed\nit as hard as you possibly could? You’d be surprised at how much more energy\nyou can exert when you’re forcefully getting yourself ready to perform the exercise. Again, it doesn’t matter what I’m doing. I could be doing a row. If I’m going to do a row, I squeeze that\nbar, I pull back on the barbell, I’m executing the movement. I’m not just going from point A to point\nB. As a beginner, the biggest mistake you can make is thinking that getting to point\nB is the goal of the exercise. JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: No. Performing the exercise with exceptional effort\nto get to point B is what you should be attempting to do on every exercise. Maybe that will cut the number of reps you\ncan do short. Another thing I can say in here – and we’re\nactually going to throw this in here as a bonus – stop counting. Don’t obsess about counting your reps. Perform well-executed reps with high effort\nevery, single time, and that will go a lot further than any half-assed number that you’re\ncounting in your head. Our last thing here is grip strength. This is kind of a pet peeve of mine. It leads to – off that last point – squeezing\nthe bar. But a lot of times, as beginners, we’ll\ngo out and hire a trainer. I’m not against trainers, guys. I’ve been there and know – I’ve trained\npeople. The fact is, people that go out and hire trainers\nas beginners and then let them rack all their weights for them, get all their dumbbells\nfor them, put all their plates on their bars for them; they’re literally costing them\nsome major benefits that come from getting, and doing that yourself. A lot of us have gone through the school of\nhard knocks, Jesse. Me, included. I used to train in my basement. I grew up training in my basement. I didn’t have a trainer. I took all my weights. I had the bar fall on my chest like this during\na bench-press, had to yell for my grandmother – whom I lived with – and she said – she\ncouldn’t hear me from there. So I had to do one of those ‘let the bar\nfall and all the plates fall off the side’. JESSE: Did you do the roll-down? JEFF: I’ve tried all of them. I’ve been stuck in those situations before. But we’ve had to go and put ourselves through\nthe paces ourselves. The fact is, going and letting someone rack\nour weights; you’re costing yourself a great opportunity to build, and develop your grip\nstrength, forearm strength. That’s going to set a huge foundation for\nattacking these big lifts as you go. You’ll be amazed at how much grip strength,\nhand strength, forearm strength will translate to your ability to lift more weight. Your ability to row more weight. Your ability to start adding more weight to\nthose exercises to where you can start to see the benefits as you as you go. So, there you have it, guys. Six tips here for beginners. Actually, we had that bonus tip. The fact is, you can apply them even if you’re\nnot necessarily any ‘ranked’ beginner. I mean, Jesse is making a transition. JESSE: Who you calling a beginner here? I had a 405 deadlift the other day. JEFF: Man, you’ve changed. JESSE: It’s the fame! It’s your fault! You made me this way. JEFF: His head doesn’t even fit in this\nhat anymore. Good job on that. And over in the mid-150s now for bodyweight,\nright? JESSE: Yeah. JEFF: So, he’s not the biggest guy in the\nworld, but he’s getting there, guys. The fact is, everybody starts somewhere. I’ve said this a million times before. I started somewhere. Jesse started somewhere. Even the biggest, strongest guys in the world\nhave started somewhere. The key is that you start, and the key is\nthat you continue. Guys, I hope this channel in its entirety\nis an inspiration for your to do both of those things. Start, if you haven’t already. Continue if you are already doing so. And continue to learn because that’s what\nit’s all about. If you’re looking for a program that lays\nit all out step by step, the ATHLEANX training programs are all available over at ATHLEANX.com. In the meantime, if you’ve found this video\nhelpful leave your comments and thumbs up below. If you’re glad that Jesse is out of hiding\nleave him a couple comments and a little bit of love, too. In the meantime, we’ll be back here again\nin just a couple days. See ya. JESSE: Bye-bye."
